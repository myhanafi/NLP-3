A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\\n\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\n\"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.\"\\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\"'"

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be       on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well       fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is       considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their       daughters.        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mr. Bennet,â\\x80\\x9d said his lady to him one day, â\\x80\\x9chave you       heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.        â\\x80\\x9cBut it is,â\\x80\\x9d returned she; â\\x80\\x9cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and       she told me all about it.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bennet made no answer.        â\\x80\\x9cDo not you want to know who has taken it?â\\x80\\x9d cried his wife       impatiently.        â\\x80\\x9c_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.â\\x80\\x9d        This was invitation enough.        â\\x80\\x9cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is       taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;       that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the       place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.       Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before       Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by       the end of next week.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat is his name?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBingley.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIs he married or single?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;       four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow so? how can it affect them?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mr. Bennet,â\\x80\\x9d replied his wife, â\\x80\\x9chow can you be so       tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of       them.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIs that his design in settling here?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDesign! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely       that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you       must visit him as soon as he comes.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may       send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for       as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you       the best of the party.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of       beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.       When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over       thinking of her own beauty.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he       comes into the neighbourhood.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it       would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are       determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you       know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be       impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be       very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to       assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he       chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my       little Lizzy.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better       than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as       Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always       giving _her_ the preference.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThey have none of them much to recommend them,â\\x80\\x9d replied he;       â\\x80\\x9cthey are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has       something more of quickness than her sisters.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?       You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor       nerves.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.       They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with       consideration these twenty years at least.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAh, you do not know what I suffer.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men       of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you       will not visit them.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will       visit them all.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,       reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty       years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his       character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a       woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain       temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.       The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its       solace was visiting and news.     Chapter 2        Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.       Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last       always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the       evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It       was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second       daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her       with,        â\\x80\\x9cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,â\\x80\\x9d said her       mother resentfully, â\\x80\\x9csince we are not to visit.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut you forget, mamma,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cthat we shall meet him       at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two       nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I       have no opinion of her.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo more have I,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet; â\\x80\\x9cand I am glad to find that       you do not depend on her serving you.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain       herself, began scolding one of her daughters.        â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake! Have a little       compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cKitty has no discretion in her coughs,â\\x80\\x9d said her father; â\\x80\\x9cshe       times them ill.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not cough for my own amusement,â\\x80\\x9d replied Kitty fretfully.       â\\x80\\x9cWhen is your next ball to be, Lizzy?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTo-morrow fortnight.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAye, so it is,â\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, â\\x80\\x9cand Mrs. Long does not come       back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to       introduce him, for she will not know him herself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and       introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted       with him myself; how can you be so teasing?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI honour your circumspection. A fortnightâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance is       certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by       the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else       will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their       chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,       if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.â\\x80\\x9d        The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,       â\\x80\\x9cNonsense, nonsense!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?â\\x80\\x9d cried he.       â\\x80\\x9cDo you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that       is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you       _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep       reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.â\\x80\\x9d        Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.        â\\x80\\x9cWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, â\\x80\\x9clet us return       to Mr. Bingley.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am sick of Mr. Bingley,â\\x80\\x9d cried his wife.        â\\x80\\x9cI am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so       before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not       have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually       paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.â\\x80\\x9d        The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of       Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first       tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she       had expected all the while.        â\\x80\\x9cHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should       persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to       neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is       such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and       never said a word about it till now.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr.       Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the       raptures of his wife.        â\\x80\\x9cWhat an excellent father you have, girls,â\\x80\\x9d said she, when the       door was shut. â\\x80\\x9cI do not know how you will ever make him amends       for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of       life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new       acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do       anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare       say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d said Lydia stoutly, â\\x80\\x9cI am not afraid; for though I _am_ the       youngest, Iâ\\x80\\x99m the tallest.â\\x80\\x9d        The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he       would return Mr. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s visit, and determining when they should       ask him to dinner.     Chapter 3        Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her       five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw       from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.       They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,       ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the       skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the       second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her       report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with       him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely       agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next       assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To       be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;       and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s heart were entertained.        â\\x80\\x9cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at       Netherfield,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, â\\x80\\x9cand all the       others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.â\\x80\\x9d        In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s visit, and sat       about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained       hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose       beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies       were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of       ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and       rode a black horse.        An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and       already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do       credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred       it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,       and consequently unable to accept the honour of their       invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could       not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his       arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be       always flying about from one place to another, and never settled       at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a       little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to       get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that       Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with       him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of       ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,       that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from       London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered       the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.       Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another       young man.        Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant       countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine       women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.       Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon       drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome       features, noble mien, and the report which was in general       circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having       ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine       figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than       Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned       the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to       be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his       large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most       forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be       compared with his friend.        Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the       principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,       danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and       talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable       qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him       and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and       once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other       lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the       room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His       character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man       in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there       again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,       whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into       particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters.        Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,       to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.       Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a       conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance       for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.        â\\x80\\x9cCome, Darcy,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI must have you dance. I hate to see you       standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much       better dance.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am       particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as       this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and       there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a       punishment to me to stand up with.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI would not be so fastidious as you are,â\\x80\\x9d cried Bingley,       â\\x80\\x9cfor a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant       girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of       them you see uncommonly pretty.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9c_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,â\\x80\\x9d said       Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.        â\\x80\\x9cOh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there       is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very       pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner       to introduce you.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhich do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d and turning round, he looked for a moment at       Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly       said, â\\x80\\x9cShe is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I       am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies       who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your       partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with       me.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and       Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She       told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for       she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in       anything ridiculous.        The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.       Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the       Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she       had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified       by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.       Elizabeth felt Janeâ\\x80\\x99s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned       to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough       to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet       learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good       spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which       they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still       up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present       occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an       evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had       rather hoped that all his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s views on the stranger would be       disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story       to hear.        â\\x80\\x9cOh, my dear Mr. Bennet,â\\x80\\x9d as she entered the room, â\\x80\\x9cwe have had a       most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had       been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.       Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her       quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,       my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only       creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,       he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;       but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,       you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going       down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,       and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with       Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth       with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the       _Boulanger_â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf he had had any compassion for _me_,â\\x80\\x9d cried her husband       impatiently, â\\x80\\x9che would not have danced half so much! For Godâ\\x80\\x99s       sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his       ankle in the first dance!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Bennet, â\\x80\\x9cI am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively       handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life       saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace       upon Mrs. Hurstâ\\x80\\x99s gownâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d        Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any       description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another       branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of       spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.        â\\x80\\x9cBut I can assure you,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cthat Lizzy does not lose much       by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid       man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that       there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,       fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance       with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one       of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 4        When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been       cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her       sister how very much she admired him.        â\\x80\\x9cHe is just what a young man ought to be,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9csensible,       good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!â\\x80\\x94so       much ease, with such perfect good breeding!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHe is also handsome,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cwhich a young man       ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is       thereby complete.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second       time. I did not expect such a compliment.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDid not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference       between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_       never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He       could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as       every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for       that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave       to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDear Lizzy!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in       general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good       and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a       human being in my life.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always       speak what I think.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With       _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and       nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;â\\x80\\x94one       meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or       designâ\\x80\\x94to take the good of everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s character and make it       still better, and say nothing of the badâ\\x80\\x94belongs to you alone.       And so, you like this manâ\\x80\\x99s sisters, too, do you? Their manners       are not equal to his.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCertainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when       you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,       and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a       very charming neighbour in her.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their       behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in       general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy       of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by       any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve       them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good       humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of       being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.       They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first       private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand       pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and       of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every       respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of       others. They were of a respectable family in the north of       England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories       than that their brotherâ\\x80\\x99s fortune and their own had been acquired       by trade.        Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred       thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an       estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it       likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was       now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was       doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his       temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at       Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.        His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own;       but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley       was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.       Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less       disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.       Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by       an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did       look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the       situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner       said in its praise, and took it immediately.        Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in       spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to       Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,       though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,       and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the       strength of Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and       of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was       the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was       clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and       fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.       In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was       sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually       giving offence.        The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was       sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with       pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been       most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no       stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as       to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.       Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom       there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had       felt the smallest interest, and from none received either       attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,       but she smiled too much.        Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be soâ\\x80\\x94but still they       admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,       and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet       was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt       authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.     Chapter 5        Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the       Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been       formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable       fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to       the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been       felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business       and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting       them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile       from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he       could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled       by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the       world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him       supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.       By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation       at St. Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s had made him courteous.        Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a       valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The       eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about       twenty-seven, was Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s intimate friend.        That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk       over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the       assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to       communicate.        â\\x80\\x9c_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet with       civil self-command to Miss Lucas. â\\x80\\x9c_You_ were Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s first       choice.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; but he seemed to like his second better.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.       To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired herâ\\x80\\x94indeed I rather       believe he _did_â\\x80\\x94I heard something about itâ\\x80\\x94but I hardly know       whatâ\\x80\\x94something about Mr. Robinson.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;       did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinsonâ\\x80\\x99s asking him how he       liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there       were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he       thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last       questionâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt, there       cannot be two opinions on that point.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word! Well, that was very decided indeedâ\\x80\\x94that does seem       as ifâ\\x80\\x94but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9c_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,â\\x80\\x9d       said Charlotte. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as       his friend, is he?â\\x80\\x94Poor Eliza!â\\x80\\x94to be only just _tolerable_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI beg you would not put it into Lizzyâ\\x80\\x99s head to be vexed by his       ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would       be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last       night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once       opening his lips.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAre you quite sure, maâ\\x80\\x99am?â\\x80\\x94is not there a little mistake?â\\x80\\x9d said       Jane. â\\x80\\x9cI certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAyeâ\\x80\\x94because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and       he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very       angry at being spoke to.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Bingley told me,â\\x80\\x9d said Jane, â\\x80\\x9cthat he never speaks much       unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is       remarkably agreeable.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very       agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how       it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare       say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,       and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Lucas,       â\\x80\\x9cbut I wish he had danced with Eliza.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnother time, Lizzy,â\\x80\\x9d said her mother, â\\x80\\x9cI would not dance with       _him_, if I were you.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI believe, maâ\\x80\\x99am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with       him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHis pride,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Lucas, â\\x80\\x9cdoes not offend _me_ so much as       pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot       wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,       everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I       may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is very true,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cand I could easily       forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPride,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of       her reflections, â\\x80\\x9cis a very common failing, I believe. By all       that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common       indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that       there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of       self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or       imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the       words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without       being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,       vanity to what we would have others think of us.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,â\\x80\\x9d cried a young Lucas, who came       with his sisters, â\\x80\\x9cI should not care how proud I was. I would       keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThen you would drink a great deal more than you ought,â\\x80\\x9d said       Mrs. Bennet; â\\x80\\x9cand if I were to see you at it, I should take away       your bottle directly.â\\x80\\x9d        The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare       that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.     Chapter 6        The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The       visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s pleasing       manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and       though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger       sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted       with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this       attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth       still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,       hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though       their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in       all probability from the influence of their brotherâ\\x80\\x99s admiration.       It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire       her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to       the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the       first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she       considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered       by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength       of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of       manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.        â\\x80\\x9cIt may perhaps be pleasant,â\\x80\\x9d replied Charlotte, â\\x80\\x9cto be able to       impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a       disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her       affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose       the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor       consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so       much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it       is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freelyâ\\x80\\x94a       slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us       who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.       In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection       than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may       never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If       _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton       indeed not to discover it too.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cRemember, Eliza, that he does not know Janeâ\\x80\\x99s disposition as you       do.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to       conceal it, he must find it out.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley       and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours       together; and as they always see each other in large mixed       parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in       conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every       half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is       secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as       much as she chooses.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour plan is a good one,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cwhere nothing is       in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were       determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I       should adopt it. But these are not Janeâ\\x80\\x99s feelings; she is not       acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the       degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known       him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;       she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined       in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make       her understand his character.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNot as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she       might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but       you must remember that four evenings have been also spent       togetherâ\\x80\\x94and four evenings may do a great deal.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that       they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to       any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has       been unfolded.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Charlotte, â\\x80\\x9cI wish Jane success with all my heart;       and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had       as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his       character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a       matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so       well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does       not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to       grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of       vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the       defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it       is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.â\\x80\\x9d        Occupied in observing Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s attentions to her sister,       Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming       an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy       had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at       her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he       looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it       clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good       feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark       eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.       Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure       of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her       figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting       that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was       caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly       unaware;â\\x80\\x94to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable       nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance       with.        He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards       conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with       others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William       Lucasâ\\x80\\x99s, where a large party were assembled.        â\\x80\\x9cWhat does Mr. Darcy mean,â\\x80\\x9d said she to Charlotte, â\\x80\\x9cby listening       to my conversation with Colonel Forster?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I       see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do       not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid       of him.â\\x80\\x9d        On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming       to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend       to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking       Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,        â\\x80\\x9cDid not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly       well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a       ball at Meryton?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWith great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady       energetic.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are severe on us.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Lucas. â\\x80\\x9cI am       going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!â\\x80\\x94always       wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my       vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;       but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who       must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.â\\x80\\x9d On       Miss Lucasâ\\x80\\x99s persevering, however, she added, â\\x80\\x9cVery well; if it       must be so, it must.â\\x80\\x9d And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cThere       is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar       withâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98Keep your breath to cool your porridge,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94and I shall keep       mine to swell my song.â\\x80\\x9d        Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a       song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of       several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at       the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of       being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge       and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.        Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given       her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and       conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of       excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,       had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing       half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad       to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the       request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases,       and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end       of the room.        Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of       passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and       was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir       William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.        â\\x80\\x9cWhat a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!       There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of       the first refinements of polished societies.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCertainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue       amongst the less polished societies of the world.â\\x80\\x94Every savage       can dance.â\\x80\\x9d        Sir William only smiled. â\\x80\\x9cYour friend performs delightfully,â\\x80\\x9d he       continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; â\\x80\\x9cand I       doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.       Darcy.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the       sight. Do you often dance at St. Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNever, sir.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid       it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou have a house in town, I conclude?â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Darcy bowed.        â\\x80\\x9cI had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselfâ\\x80\\x94for I am       fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that       the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.â\\x80\\x9d        He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not       disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving       towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very       gallant thing, and called out to her,        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must       allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable       partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much       beauty is before you.â\\x80\\x9d And, taking her hand, he would have given       it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not       unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said       with some discomposure to Sir William,        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I       entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg       for a partner.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the       honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor       did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at       persuasion.        â\\x80\\x9cYou excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to       deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman       dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am       sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is all politeness,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, smiling.        â\\x80\\x9cHe is, indeedâ\\x80\\x94but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss       Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object       to such a partner?â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not       injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with       some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,        â\\x80\\x9cI can guess the subject of your reverie.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI should imagine not.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many       evenings in this mannerâ\\x80\\x94in such society; and indeed I am quite of       your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet       the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all       these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more       agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great       pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman       can bestow.â\\x80\\x9d        Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired       he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such       reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Elizabeth Bennet.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Elizabeth Bennet!â\\x80\\x9d repeated Miss Bingley. â\\x80\\x9cI am all       astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?â\\x80\\x94and pray       when am I to wish you joy?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A       ladyâ\\x80\\x99s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to       love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be       wishing me joy.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as       absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,       indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with       you.â\\x80\\x9d        He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to       entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced       her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.     Chapter 7        Mr. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of       two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was       entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and       their motherâ\\x80\\x99s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,       could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been       an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.        She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk       to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother       settled in London in a respectable line of trade.        The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most       convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually       tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to       their aunt and to a millinerâ\\x80\\x99s shop just over the way. The two       youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly       frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than       their sistersâ\\x80\\x99, and when nothing better offered, a walk to       Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish       conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the       country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some       from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both       with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia       regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,       and Meryton was the headquarters.        Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most       interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their       knowledge of the officersâ\\x80\\x99 names and connections. Their lodgings       were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the       officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this       opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They       could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s large       fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was       worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an       ensign.        After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,       Mr. Bennet coolly observed,        â\\x80\\x9cFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must       be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it       some time, but I am now convinced.â\\x80\\x9d        Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with       perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of       Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the       day, as he was going the next morning to London.        â\\x80\\x9cI am astonished, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, â\\x80\\x9cthat you should be       so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think       slightingly of anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s children, it should not be of my own,       however.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of       it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThis is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not       agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every       particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two       youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the       sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I       dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.       I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very wellâ\\x80\\x94and,       indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,       with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I       shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked       very becoming the other night at Sir Williamâ\\x80\\x99s in his       regimentals.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMamma,â\\x80\\x9d cried Lydia, â\\x80\\x9cmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and       Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watsonâ\\x80\\x99s as they did       when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in       Clarkeâ\\x80\\x99s library.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman       with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the       servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s eyes sparkled with       pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter       read,        â\\x80\\x9cWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?       Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is from Miss Bingley,â\\x80\\x9d said Jane, and then read it aloud.        â\\x80\\x9cMY DEAR FRIEND,â\\x80\\x94       â\\x80\\x9cIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa       and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest       of our lives, for a whole dayâ\\x80\\x99s _tÃªte-Ã\\xa0-tÃªte_ between two women       can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the       receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with       the officers.â\\x80\\x94Yours ever,        â\\x80\\x9cCAROLINE BINGLEYâ\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWith the officers!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lydia. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder my aunt did not tell       us of _that_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDining out,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, â\\x80\\x9cthat is very unlucky.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCan I have the carriage?â\\x80\\x9d said Jane.        â\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems       likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat would be a good scheme,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cif you were sure       that they would not offer to send her home.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s chaise to go to       Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI had much rather go in the coach.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.       They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThey are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut if you have got them to-day,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cmy motherâ\\x80\\x99s       purpose will be answered.â\\x80\\x9d        She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the       horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on       horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many       cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane       had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were       uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued       the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not       come back.        â\\x80\\x9cThis was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, more       than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.       Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the       felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a       servant from Netherfield brought the following note for       Elizabeth:        â\\x80\\x9cMY DEAREST LIZZY,â\\x80\\x94       â\\x80\\x9cI find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to       be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends       will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also       on my seeing Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x94therefore do not be alarmed if you should       hear of his having been to meâ\\x80\\x94and, excepting a sore throat and       headache, there is not much the matter with me.â\\x80\\x94Yours, &c.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWell, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the       note aloud, â\\x80\\x9cif your daughter should have a dangerous fit of       illnessâ\\x80\\x94if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it       was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little       trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she       stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I       could have the carriage.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,       though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no       horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her       resolution.        â\\x80\\x9cHow can you be so silly,â\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, â\\x80\\x9cas to think of such       a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when       you get there.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI shall be very fit to see Janeâ\\x80\\x94which is all I want.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIs this a hint to me, Lizzy,â\\x80\\x9d said her father, â\\x80\\x9cto send for the       horses?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is       nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back       by dinner.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI admire the activity of your benevolence,â\\x80\\x9d observed Mary, â\\x80\\x9cbut       every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my       opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is       required.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe will go as far as Meryton with you,â\\x80\\x9d said Catherine and       Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young       ladies set off together.        â\\x80\\x9cIf we make haste,â\\x80\\x9d said Lydia, as they walked along, â\\x80\\x9cperhaps we       may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.â\\x80\\x9d        In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings       of one of the officersâ\\x80\\x99 wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk       alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over       stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and       finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary       ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of       exercise.        She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were       assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of       surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the       day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible       to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that       they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very       politely by them; and in their brotherâ\\x80\\x99s manners there was       something better than politeness; there was good humour and       kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at       all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy       which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the       occasionâ\\x80\\x99s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was       thinking only of his breakfast.        Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.       Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and       not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken       to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the       fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note       how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her       entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and       when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little       beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness       she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.        When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and       Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much       affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary       came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be       supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must       endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,       and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,       for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.       Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other       ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact       nothing to do elsewhere.        When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and       very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,       and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane       testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was       obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to       remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully       consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint       the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.     Chapter 8        At five oâ\\x80\\x99clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past       six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries       which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of       distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s, she       could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means       better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four       times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a       bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;       and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference       towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth       to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.        Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she       could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was       evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they       prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed       she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from       any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister       scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he       was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at       cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,       had nothing to say to her.        When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss       Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her       manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride       and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.       Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,        â\\x80\\x9cShe has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an       excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this       morning. She really looked almost wild.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.       Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering       about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so       untidy, so blowsy!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches       deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been       let down to hide it not doing its office.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour picture may be very exact, Louisa,â\\x80\\x9d said Bingley; â\\x80\\x9cbut this       was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked       remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her       dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9c_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley;       â\\x80\\x9cand I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your       sister_ make such an exhibition.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCertainly not.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTo walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever       it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what       could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort       of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to       decorum.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,â\\x80\\x9d       said Bingley.        â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid, Mr. Darcy,â\\x80\\x9d observed Miss Bingley, in a half       whisper, â\\x80\\x9cthat this adventure has rather affected your admiration       of her fine eyes.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNot at all,â\\x80\\x9d he replied; â\\x80\\x9cthey were brightened by the exercise.â\\x80\\x9d       A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.        â\\x80\\x9cI have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a       very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well       settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low       connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in       Meryton.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is capital,â\\x80\\x9d added her sister, and they both laughed       heartily.        â\\x80\\x9cIf they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,â\\x80\\x9d cried       Bingley, â\\x80\\x9cit would not make them one jot less agreeable.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men       of any consideration in the world,â\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy.        To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it       their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at       the expense of their dear friendâ\\x80\\x99s vulgar relations.        With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room       on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to       coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit       her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of       seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than       pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the       drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was       immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be       playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse,       said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay       below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.        â\\x80\\x9cDo you prefer reading to cards?â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9cthat is rather       singular.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Eliza Bennet,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, â\\x80\\x9cdespises cards. She is a       great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI deserve neither such praise nor such censure,â\\x80\\x9d cried       Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cI am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in       many things.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIn nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,â\\x80\\x9d said       Bingley; â\\x80\\x9cand I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her       quite well.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a       table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to       fetch her others; all that his library afforded.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own       credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I       have more than I ever looked into.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with       those in the room.        â\\x80\\x9cI am astonished,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, â\\x80\\x9cthat my father should have       left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library       you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt ought to be good,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cit has been the work of many       generations.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always       buying books.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days       as these.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNeglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the       beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_       house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI wish it may.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut I would really advise you to make your purchase in that       neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is       not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWith all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will       sell it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am talking of possibilities, Charles.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get       Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her       very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly       aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself       between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.        â\\x80\\x9cIs Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley;       â\\x80\\x9cwill she be as tall as I am?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s       height, or rather taller.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who       delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners!â\\x80\\x94and so       extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the       pianoforte is exquisite.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is amazing to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Bingley, â\\x80\\x9chow young ladies can have       patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAll young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you       mean?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens,       and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this,       and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first       time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour list of the common extent of accomplishments,â\\x80\\x9d said Darcy,       â\\x80\\x9chas too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who       deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a       screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your       estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more       than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that       are really accomplished.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNor I, I am sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley.        â\\x80\\x9cThen,â\\x80\\x9d observed Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cyou must comprehend a great deal in       your idea of an accomplished woman.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! certainly,â\\x80\\x9d cried his faithful assistant, â\\x80\\x9cno one can be       really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is       usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of       music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to       deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a       certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of       her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but       half deserved.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAll this she must possess,â\\x80\\x9d added Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cand to all this she       must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of       her mind by extensive reading.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished       women. I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAre you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility       of all this?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9c_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and       taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice       of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew       many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called       them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to       what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an       end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.        â\\x80\\x9cEliza Bennet,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed       on her, â\\x80\\x9cis one of those young ladies who seek to recommend       themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with       many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a       paltry device, a very mean art.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly,â\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly       addressed, â\\x80\\x9cthere is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies       sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears       affinity to cunning is despicable.â\\x80\\x9d        Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to       continue the subject.        Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was       worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s       being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no       country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to       town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not       hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their       brotherâ\\x80\\x99s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be       sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly       better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared       that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,       however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better       relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions       that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her       sister.     Chapter 9        Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s room, and       in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable       answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.       Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two       elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this       amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to       Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own       judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched,       and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet,       accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon       after the family breakfast.        Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have       been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her       illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering       immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove       her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her       daughterâ\\x80\\x99s proposal of being carried home; neither did the       apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all       advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss       Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s appearance and invitation, the mother and three       daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley       met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet       worse than she expected.        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed I have, sir,â\\x80\\x9d was her answer. â\\x80\\x9cShe is a great deal too       ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.       We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cRemoved!â\\x80\\x9d cried Bingley. â\\x80\\x9cIt must not be thought of. My sister,       I am sure, will not hear of her removal.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou may depend upon it, Madam,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, with cold       civility, â\\x80\\x9cthat Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention       while she remains with us.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.        â\\x80\\x9cI am sure,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cif it was not for such good friends I do       not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,       and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the       world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without       exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell       my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room       here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.       I do not know a place in the country that is equal to       Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I       hope, though you have but a short lease.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhatever I do is done in a hurry,â\\x80\\x9d replied he; â\\x80\\x9cand therefore if       I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in       five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite       fixed here.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly what I should have supposed of you,â\\x80\\x9d said       Elizabeth.        â\\x80\\x9cYou begin to comprehend me, do you?â\\x80\\x9d cried he, turning towards       her.        â\\x80\\x9cOh! yesâ\\x80\\x94I understand you perfectly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily       seen through I am afraid is pitiful.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate       character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLizzy,â\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, â\\x80\\x9cremember where you are, and do not       run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI did not know before,â\\x80\\x9d continued Bingley immediately, â\\x80\\x9cthat you       were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have       at least that advantage.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThe country,â\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, â\\x80\\x9ccan in general supply but few       subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in       a very confined and unvarying society.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new       to be observed in them for ever.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of       mentioning a country neighbourhood. â\\x80\\x9cI assure you there is quite       as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.â\\x80\\x9d        Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a       moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had       gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.        â\\x80\\x9cI cannot see that London has any great advantage over the       country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The       country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhen I am in the country,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cI never wish to leave       it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have       each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAyeâ\\x80\\x94that is because you have the right disposition. But that       gentleman,â\\x80\\x9d looking at Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cseemed to think the country was       nothing at all.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Mama, you are mistaken,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, blushing for       her mother. â\\x80\\x9cYou quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that       there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the       country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCertainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not       meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there       are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with       four-and-twenty families.â\\x80\\x9d        Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep       his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her       eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth,       for the sake of saying something that might turn her motherâ\\x80\\x99s       thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn       since _her_ coming away.        â\\x80\\x9cYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man       Sir William is, Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x94is not he? so much the man of       fashion! So genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to       everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons       who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths,       quite mistake the matter.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDid Charlotte dine with you?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the       mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants       that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up       differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the       Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity       they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_       plainâ\\x80\\x94but then she is our particular friend.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe seems a very pleasant young woman,â\\x80\\x9d said Bingley.        â\\x80\\x9cOh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas       herself has often said so, and envied me Janeâ\\x80\\x99s beauty. I do not       like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Janeâ\\x80\\x94one does not       often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do       not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was       a gentleman at my brother Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s in town so much in love with her,       that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before       we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her       too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty       they were.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd so ended his affection,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cThere       has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder       who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away       love!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,â\\x80\\x9d said       Darcy.        â\\x80\\x9cOf a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what       is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of       inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it       entirely away.â\\x80\\x9d        Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made       Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself       again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;       and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks       to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for       troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil       in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,       and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed       without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and       soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the       youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had       been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the       result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with       having promised on his first coming into the country to give a       ball at Netherfield.        Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine       complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her       mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early       age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural       self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom       her uncleâ\\x80\\x99s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended       her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore,       to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly       reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most       shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to       this sudden attack was delightful to their motherâ\\x80\\x99s ear.        â\\x80\\x9cI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and       when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the       very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while       she is ill.â\\x80\\x9d        Lydia declared herself satisfied. â\\x80\\x9cOh! yesâ\\x80\\x94it would be much       better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely       Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given       _your_ ball,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cI shall insist on their giving one       also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he       does not.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth       returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relationsâ\\x80\\x99       behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the       latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in       their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s witticisms       on _fine eyes_.     Chapter 10        The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and       Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the       invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the       evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The       loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and       Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his       letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to       his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.       Hurst was observing their game.        Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in       attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The       perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting,       or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter,       with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received,       formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her       opinion of each.        â\\x80\\x9cHow delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!â\\x80\\x9d        He made no answer.        â\\x80\\x9cYou write uncommonly fast.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are mistaken. I write rather slowly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow many letters you must have occasion to write in the course       of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think       them!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to       yours.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPray tell your sister that I long to see her.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have already told her so once, by your desire.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I       mend pens remarkably well.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThank youâ\\x80\\x94but I always mend my own.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow can you contrive to write so even?â\\x80\\x9d        He was silent.        â\\x80\\x9cTell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on       the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with       her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it       infinitely superior to Miss Grantleyâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWill you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write       again? At present I have not room to do them justice.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do       you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThey are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not       for me to determine.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter       with ease, cannot write ill.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,â\\x80\\x9d cried her       brother, â\\x80\\x9cbecause he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too       much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy style of writing is very different from yours.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Bingley, â\\x80\\x9cCharles writes in the most careless       way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the       rest.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express themâ\\x80\\x94by       which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my       correspondents.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour humility, Mr. Bingley,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cmust disarm       reproof.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNothing is more deceitful,â\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cthan the appearance of       humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes       an indirect boast.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of       modesty?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThe indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in       writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity       of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not       estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of       doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the       possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of       the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if       you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in       five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of       compliment to yourselfâ\\x80\\x94and yet what is there so very laudable in       a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone,       and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNay,â\\x80\\x9d cried Bingley, â\\x80\\x9cthis is too much, to remember at night all       the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon       my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I       believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume       the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before       the ladies.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that       you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite       as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you       were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, â\\x80\\x98Bingley, you had       better stay till next week,â\\x80\\x99 you would probably do it, you would       probably not goâ\\x80\\x94and, at another word, might stay a month.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou have only proved by this,â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cthat Mr.       Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown       him off now much more than he did himself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am exceedingly gratified,â\\x80\\x9d said Bingley, â\\x80\\x9cby your converting       what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my       temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that       gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think       the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat       denial, and ride off as fast as I could.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWould Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original       intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must       speak for himself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call       mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case,       however, to stand according to your representation, you must       remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire       his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely       desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of       its propriety.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTo yield readilyâ\\x80\\x94easilyâ\\x80\\x94to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no       merit with you.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTo yield without conviction is no compliment to the       understanding of either.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence       of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would       often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for       arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking       of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as       well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we       discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general       and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them       is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great       moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with       the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWill it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to       arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which       is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of       intimacy subsisting between the parties?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBy all means,â\\x80\\x9d cried Bingley; â\\x80\\x9clet us hear all the particulars,       not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will       have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be       aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall       fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so       much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than       Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his       own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has       nothing to do.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that       he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss       Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an       expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.        â\\x80\\x9cI see your design, Bingley,â\\x80\\x9d said his friend. â\\x80\\x9cYou dislike an       argument, and want to silence this.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and       Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall       be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat you ask,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cis no sacrifice on my side; and       Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.        When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and       Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved       with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request       that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and       more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.        Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus       employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over       some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.       Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose       that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and       yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still       more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last, that she       drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and       reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other       person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him       too little to care for his approbation.        After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm       by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing       near Elizabeth, said to herâ\\x80\\x94        â\\x80\\x9cDo not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such       an opportunity of dancing a reel?â\\x80\\x9d        She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with       some surprise at her silence.        â\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cI heard you before; but I could not immediately       determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say       â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;       but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and       cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have,       therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to       dance a reel at allâ\\x80\\x94and now despise me if you dare.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed I do not dare.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at       his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness       in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;       and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by       her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of       her connections, he should be in some danger.        Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her       great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received       some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.        She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by       talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in       such an alliance.        â\\x80\\x9cI hope,â\\x80\\x9d said she, as they were walking together in the       shrubbery the next day, â\\x80\\x9cyou will give your mother-in-law a few       hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage       of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the       younger girls of running after the officers. And, if I may mention so       delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,       bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady       possesses.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHave you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be       placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your       great uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know,       only in different lines. As for your Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s picture, you       must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to       those beautiful eyes?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but       their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,       might be copied.â\\x80\\x9d        At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and       Elizabeth herself.        â\\x80\\x9cI did not know that you intended to walk,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, in       some confusion, lest they had been overheard.        â\\x80\\x9cYou used us abominably ill,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mrs. Hurst, â\\x80\\x9crunning away       without telling us that you were coming out.â\\x80\\x9d        Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth       to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt       their rudeness, and immediately said,â\\x80\\x94        â\\x80\\x9cThis walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go       into the avenue.â\\x80\\x9d        But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with       them, laughingly answered,        â\\x80\\x9cNo, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and       appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by       admitting a fourth. Good-bye.â\\x80\\x9d        She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the       hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so       much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of       hours that evening.     Chapter 11        When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her       sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into       the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with       many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them       so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the       gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were       considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy,       relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance       with spirit.        But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first       object; Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,       and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many       steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite       congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he       was â\\x80\\x9cvery glad;â\\x80\\x9d but diffuseness and warmth remained for       Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first       half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer       from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the       other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the       door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone       else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with       great delight.        When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the       card-tableâ\\x80\\x94but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence       that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found       even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one       intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the       subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to       do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.       Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,       principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings,       joined now and then in her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s conversation with Miss       Bennet.        Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s attention was quite as much engaged in watching       Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own;       and she was perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at       his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he       merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite       exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which       she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she       gave a great yawn and said, â\\x80\\x9cHow pleasant it is to spend an       evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment       like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a       book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I       have not an excellent library.â\\x80\\x9d        No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her       book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some       amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss       Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:        â\\x80\\x9cBy the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a       dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on       it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much       mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be       rather a punishment than a pleasure.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf you mean Darcy,â\\x80\\x9d cried her brother, â\\x80\\x9che may go to bed, if he       chooses, before it beginsâ\\x80\\x94but as for the ball, it is quite a       settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup       enough, I shall send round my cards.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI should like balls infinitely better,â\\x80\\x9d she replied, â\\x80\\x9cif they       were carried on in a different manner; but there is something       insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It       would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of       dancing were made the order of the day.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMuch more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would       not be near so much like a ball.â\\x80\\x9d        Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and       walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked       well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly       studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one       effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and       take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing       after sitting so long in one attitude.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss       Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.       Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention       in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously       closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but       he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives       for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with       either of which motives his joining them would interfere. â\\x80\\x9cWhat       could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his       meaning?â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand       him?        â\\x80\\x9cNot at all,â\\x80\\x9d was her answer; â\\x80\\x9cbut depend upon it, he means to be       severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to       ask nothing about it.â\\x80\\x9d        Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy       in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation       of his two motives.        â\\x80\\x9cI have not the smallest objection to explaining them,â\\x80\\x9d said he,       as soon as she allowed him to speak. â\\x80\\x9cYou either choose this       method of passing the evening because you are in each otherâ\\x80\\x99s       confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you       are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage       in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and       if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the       fire.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! shocking!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Bingley. â\\x80\\x9cI never heard anything so       abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,â\\x80\\x9d said       Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cWe can all plague and punish one another. Tease       himâ\\x80\\x94laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to       be done.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy       has not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and       presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to       laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by       attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug       himself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cThat is an       uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it       would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I       dearly love a laugh.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Bingley,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9chas given me more credit than can be.       The wisest and the best of menâ\\x80\\x94nay, the wisest and best of their       actionsâ\\x80\\x94may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object       in life is a joke.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCertainly,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabethâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthere are such people, but I hope       I am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and       good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_       divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,       I suppose, are precisely what you are without.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the       study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a       strong understanding to ridicule.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cSuch as vanity and pride.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But prideâ\\x80\\x94where there is a       real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good       regulation.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.        â\\x80\\x9cYour examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss       Bingley; â\\x80\\x9cand pray what is the result?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He       owns it himself without disguise.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cI have made no such pretension. I have faults       enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I       dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little       yieldingâ\\x80\\x94certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I       cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought,       nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed       about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be       called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9c_That_ is a failing indeed!â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cImplacable       resentment _is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your       fault well. I really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThere is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some       particular evilâ\\x80\\x94a natural defect, which not even the best       education can overcome.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd _your_ defect is to hate everybody.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd yours,â\\x80\\x9d he replied with a smile, â\\x80\\x9cis willfully to       misunderstand them.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDo let us have a little music,â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Bingley, tired of a       conversation in which she had no share. â\\x80\\x9cLouisa, you will not       mind my waking Mr. Hurst?â\\x80\\x9d        Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was       opened; and Darcy, after a few momentsâ\\x80\\x99 recollection, was not       sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too       much attention.     Chapter 12        In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth       wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage       might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet,       who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till       the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Janeâ\\x80\\x99s week,       could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her       answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to       Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.       Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the       carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that       if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she       could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however,       Elizabeth was positively resolvedâ\\x80\\x94nor did she much expect it       would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered       as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow       Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled       that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning       should be mentioned, and the request made.        The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough       was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day       to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.       Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for       her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her       affection for the other.        The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to       go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it       would not be safe for herâ\\x80\\x94that she was not enough recovered; but       Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.        To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligenceâ\\x80\\x94Elizabeth had been at       Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he likedâ\\x80\\x94and       Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to       himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no       sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could       elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible       that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the       last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.       Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through       the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by       themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to       his book, and would not even look at her.        On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to       almost all, took place. Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s civility to Elizabeth       increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for       Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the       pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn       or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook       hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in       the liveliest of spirits.        They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.       Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to       give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold       again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions       of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their       importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when       they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and       almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.        They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and       human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new       observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and       Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been       done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding       Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their       uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been       hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.     Chapter 13        â\\x80\\x9cI hope, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at       breakfast the next morning, â\\x80\\x9cthat you have ordered a good dinner       to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family       party.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWho do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am       sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call inâ\\x80\\x94and I hope       _my_ dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often       sees such at home.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThe person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s eyes sparkled. â\\x80\\x9cA gentleman and a stranger! It is       Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad       to see Mr. Bingley. Butâ\\x80\\x94good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a       bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bellâ\\x80\\x94I       must speak to Hill this moment.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley,â\\x80\\x9d said her husband; â\\x80\\x9cit is a person whom       I never saw in the whole course of my life.â\\x80\\x9d        This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of       being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at       once.        After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus       explained:        â\\x80\\x9cAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight       ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and       requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins,       who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon       as he pleases.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear,â\\x80\\x9d cried his wife, â\\x80\\x9cI cannot bear to hear that       mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is       the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be       entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had       been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other       about it.â\\x80\\x9d        Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an       entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a       subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and       she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an       estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man       whom nobody cared anything about.        â\\x80\\x9cIt certainly is a most iniquitous affair,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, â\\x80\\x9cand       nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting       Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps       be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very       impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.       I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling       with you, as his father did before him?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhy, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on       that head, as you will hear.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15_th October_.        â\\x80\\x9cDear Sir,â\\x80\\x94       â\\x80\\x9cThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late       honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have       had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal       the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,       fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to       be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him       to be at variance.â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98There, Mrs. Bennet.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94My mind, however, is now       made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter,       I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage       of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir       Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to       the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest       endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her       ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies       which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,       moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing       of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on       these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are       highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in       the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your       side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I       cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring       your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as       well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible       amendsâ\\x80\\x94but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to       receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of       waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four       oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the       Saturday seâ\\x80\\x99ennight following, which I can do without any       inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my       occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other       clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.â\\x80\\x94I remain, dear       sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your       well-wisher and friend,        â\\x80\\x9cWILLIAM COLLINSâ\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAt four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making       gentleman,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. â\\x80\\x9cHe       seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my       word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,       especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him       come to us again.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThere is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,       and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the       person to discourage him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThough it is difficult,â\\x80\\x9d said Jane, â\\x80\\x9cto guess in what way he can       mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is       certainly to his credit.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for       Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,       and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.        â\\x80\\x9cHe must be an oddity, I think,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cI cannot make him       out.â\\x80\\x94There is something very pompous in his style.â\\x80\\x94And what can       he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?â\\x80\\x94We cannot       suppose he would help it if he could.â\\x80\\x94Could he be a sensible man,       sir?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him       quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and       self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am       impatient to see him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIn point of composition,â\\x80\\x9d said Mary, â\\x80\\x9cthe letter does not seem       defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly       new, yet I think it is well expressed.â\\x80\\x9d        To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in       any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their       cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks       since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any       other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s letter had done       away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with       a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.        Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great       politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little;       but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed       neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent       himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of       five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners       were very formal. He had not been long seated before he       complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters;       said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance       fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not       doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.       This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers;       but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most       readily.        â\\x80\\x9cYou are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it       may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are       settled so oddly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAh! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,       you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for       such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no       knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,       and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of       appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young       ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not       say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquaintedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d        He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled       on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s       admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture,       were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything       would have touched Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s heart, but for the mortifying       supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The       dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know       to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was       owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him       with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good       cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He       begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she       declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to       apologise for about a quarter of an hour.     Chapter 14        During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the       servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some       conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in       which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very       fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourghâ\\x80\\x99s attention       to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very       remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins       was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than       usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he       protested that â\\x80\\x9che had never in his life witnessed such behaviour       in a person of rankâ\\x80\\x94such affability and condescension, as he had       himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously       pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already       had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him       twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday       before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady       Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had       never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken       to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the       smallest objection to his joining in the society of the       neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a       week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to       advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with       discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble       parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations       he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some       herselfâ\\x80\\x94some shelves in the closet up stairs.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is all very proper and civil, I am sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet,       â\\x80\\x9cand I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that       great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near       you, sir?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThe garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by       a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s residence.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very       extensive property.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, â\\x80\\x9cthen she is better off       than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she       handsome?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself       says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far       superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in       her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.       She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has       prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments       which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by       the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides       with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to       drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHas she been presented? I do not remember her name among the       ladies at court.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHer indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in       town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has       deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her       ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I       am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate       compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more       than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter       seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank,       instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These       are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it       is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound       to pay.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou judge very properly,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, â\\x80\\x9cand it is happy for       you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May       I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse       of the moment, or are the result of previous study?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThey arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though       I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such       little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary       occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as       possible.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as       absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest       enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute       composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at       Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.        By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet       was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when       tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr.       Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on       beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a       circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,       protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and       Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some       deliberation he chose Fordyceâ\\x80\\x99s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened       the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity,       read three pages, she interrupted him with:        â\\x80\\x9cDo you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away       Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt       told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow       to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from       town.â\\x80\\x9d        Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but       Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:        â\\x80\\x9cI have often observed how little young ladies are interested by       books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their       benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be       nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no       longer importune my young cousin.â\\x80\\x9d        Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist       at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that       he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling       amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly       for Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s interruption, and promised that it should not occur       again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after       assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and       should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself       at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.     Chapter 15        Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature       had been but little assisted by education or society; the       greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of       an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one       of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms,       without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in       which his father had brought him up had given him originally       great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted       by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the       consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A       fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh       when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he       felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his       patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his       authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him       altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance       and humility.        Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended       to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn       family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the       daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were       represented by common report. This was his plan of amendsâ\\x80\\x94of       atonementâ\\x80\\x94for inheriting their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s estate; and he thought it       an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and       excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.        His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s lovely face       confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of       what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was       his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an       alteration; for in a quarter of an hourâ\\x80\\x99s _tÃªte-Ã\\xa0-tÃªte_ with Mrs.       Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his       parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his       hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn,       produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general       encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.       â\\x80\\x9cAs to her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to       sayâ\\x80\\x94she could not positively answerâ\\x80\\x94but she did not _know_ of any       prepossession; her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mentionâ\\x80\\x94she       felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon       engaged.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabethâ\\x80\\x94and it was       soon doneâ\\x80\\x94done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.       Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded       her of course.        Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might       soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not       bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.        Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every       sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to       attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious       to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither       Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would       continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the       collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little       cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings       discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been       always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as       he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other       room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his       civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to       join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact       much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely       pleased to close his large book, and go.        In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his       cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The       attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by       _him_. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in       quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet       indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall       them.        But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,       whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike       appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the       way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return       from London Lydia came to enquire, and he bowed as they passed.       All were struck with the strangerâ\\x80\\x99s air, all wondered who he       could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find       out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting       something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained       the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached       the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated       permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned       with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had       accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it       should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him       completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he       had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good       figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed       up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationâ\\x80\\x94a readiness       at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole       party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,       when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley       were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of       the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and       began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,       and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on       his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her. Mr. Darcy       corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to       fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by       the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the       countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all       astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,       one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few       moments, touched his hatâ\\x80\\x94a salutation which Mr. Darcy just       deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was       impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.        In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have       noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.        Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the       door of Mr. Phillipâ\\x80\\x99s house, and then made their bows, in spite       of Miss Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and       even in spite of Mrs. Phillipsâ\\x80\\x99s throwing up the parlour window       and loudly seconding the invitation.        Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two       eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and       she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return       home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she       should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see       Mr. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they       were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the       Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed       towards Mr. Collins by Janeâ\\x80\\x99s introduction of him. She received       him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much       more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous       acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering       himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the       young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was       quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her       contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by       exclamations and enquiries about the other; of whom, however, she       could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny       had brought him from London, and that he was to have a       lieutenantâ\\x80\\x99s commission in the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire. She had been watching him       the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and       had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have       continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now       except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the       stranger, were become â\\x80\\x9cstupid, disagreeable fellows.â\\x80\\x9d Some of       them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their       aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give       him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come       in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested       that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery       tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect       of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual       good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the       room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were       perfectly needless.        As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen       pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have       defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong,       she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.        Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by       admiring Mrs. Phillipsâ\\x80\\x99s manners and politeness. He protested       that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a       more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the       utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her       invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her       before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his       connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much       attention in the whole course of his life.     Chapter 16        As no objection was made to the young peopleâ\\x80\\x99s engagement with       their aunt, and all Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s scruples of leaving Mr. and       Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most       steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at       a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of       hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had       accepted their uncleâ\\x80\\x99s invitation, and was then in the house.        When this information was given, and they had all taken their       seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,       and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the       apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself       in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison       that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.       Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its       proprietorâ\\x80\\x94when she had listened to the description of only one       of Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s drawing-rooms, and found that the       chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all       the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a       comparison with the housekeeperâ\\x80\\x99s room.        In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her       mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble       abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily       employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.       Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his       consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving       to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To       the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had       nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their       own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the       interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last,       however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked       into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing       him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree       of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire were in       general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of       them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond       them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were       superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing       port wine, who followed them into the room.        Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female       eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he       finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he       immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its       being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest,       most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill       of the speaker.        With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and       the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to       the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at       intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her       watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.       When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of       obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.        â\\x80\\x9cI know little of the game at present,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cbut I shall be       glad to improve myself, for in my situation in lifeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Mrs.       Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for       his reason.        Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he       received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first       there seemed danger of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s engrossing him entirely, for she       was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond       of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the       game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to       have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common       demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk       to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what       she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be toldâ\\x80\\x94the       history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even       mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly       relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He enquired how       far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her       answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been       staying there.        â\\x80\\x9cAbout a month,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the       subject drop, added, â\\x80\\x9cHe is a man of very large property in       Derbyshire, I understand.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Wickham; â\\x80\\x9chis estate there is a noble one. A       clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a       person more capable of giving you certain information on that       head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a       particular manner from my infancy.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could not but look surprised.        â\\x80\\x9cYou may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,       after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our       meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAs much as I ever wish to be,â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth very warmly. â\\x80\\x9cI       have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him       very disagreeable.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have no right to give _my_ opinion,â\\x80\\x9d said Wickham, â\\x80\\x9cas to his       being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I       have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is       impossible for _me_ to be impartial. But I believe your opinion       of him would in general astonishâ\\x80\\x94and perhaps you would not       express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your       own family.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house       in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked       in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will       not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI cannot pretend to be sorry,â\\x80\\x9d said Wickham, after a short       interruption, â\\x80\\x9cthat he or that any man should not be estimated       beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often       happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or       frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as       he chooses to be seen.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an       ill-tempered man.â\\x80\\x9d Wickham only shook his head.        â\\x80\\x9cI wonder,â\\x80\\x9d said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,       â\\x80\\x9cwhether he is likely to be in this country much longer.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away       when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the       â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! noâ\\x80\\x94it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If       _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on       friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I       have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim       before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most       painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet,       the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,       and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company       with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a       thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been       scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and       everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and       disgracing the memory of his father.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and       listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented       further enquiry.        Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the       neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all       that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but       very intelligible gallantry.        â\\x80\\x9cIt was the prospect of constant society, and good society,â\\x80\\x9d he       added, â\\x80\\x9cwhich was my chief inducement to enter the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire. I       knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend       Denny tempted me further by his account of their present       quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent       acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is       necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits       will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society. A       military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances       have now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my       professionâ\\x80\\x94I was brought up for the church, and I should at this       time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it       pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of       the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively       attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to       provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the       living fell, it was given elsewhere.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cbut how could _that_ be? How       could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal       redress?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThere was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest       as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have       doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt itâ\\x80\\x94or to       treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert       that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,       imprudenceâ\\x80\\x94in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the       living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to       hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less       certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done       anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper,       and I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too       freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are       very different sort of men, and that he hates me.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThis is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cSome time or other he _will_ beâ\\x80\\x94but it shall not be by _me_.       Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him       handsomer than ever as he expressed them.        â\\x80\\x9cBut what,â\\x80\\x9d said she, after a pause, â\\x80\\x9ccan have been his motive?       What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cA thorough, determined dislike of meâ\\x80\\x94a dislike which I cannot       but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy       liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his       fatherâ\\x80\\x99s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very       early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of       competition in which we stoodâ\\x80\\x94the sort of preference which was       often given me.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as thisâ\\x80\\x94though I have never       liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed       him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not       suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such       injustice, such inhumanity as this.â\\x80\\x9d        After a few minutesâ\\x80\\x99 reflection, however, she continued, â\\x80\\x9cI _do_       remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the       implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving       temper. His disposition must be dreadful.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI will not trust myself on the subject,â\\x80\\x9d replied Wickham; â\\x80\\x9c_I_       can hardly be just to him.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,       â\\x80\\x9cTo treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite       of his father!â\\x80\\x9d She could have added, â\\x80\\x9cA young man, too, like       _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being       amiableâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94but she contented herself with, â\\x80\\x9cand one, too, who had       probably been his companion from childhood, connected together,       as I think you said, in the closest manner!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe were born in the same parish, within the same park; the       greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the       same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same       parental care. _My_ father began life in the profession which       your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit toâ\\x80\\x94but he       gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted       all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most       highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential       friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the       greatest obligations to my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s active superintendence, and       when, immediately before my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a       voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he       felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his       affection to myself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow strange!â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cHow abominable! I wonder that       the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If       from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to       be dishonestâ\\x80\\x94for dishonesty I must call it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt _is_ wonderful,â\\x80\\x9d replied Wickham, â\\x80\\x9cfor almost all his actions       may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.       It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other       feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour       to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCan such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give       his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants,       and relieve the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ prideâ\\x80\\x94for he is       very proud of what his father wasâ\\x80\\x94have done this. Not to appear       to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities,       or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful       motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_       brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian       of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the       most attentive and best of brothers.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of girl is Miss Darcy?â\\x80\\x9d        He shook his head. â\\x80\\x9cI wish I could call her amiable. It gives me       pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her       brotherâ\\x80\\x94very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and       pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and       hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a       handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand,       highly accomplished. Since her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s death, her home has been       London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her       education.â\\x80\\x9d        After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth       could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:        â\\x80\\x9cI am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr.       Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,       truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they       suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNot at all.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHe is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know       what Mr. Darcy is.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cProbably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does       not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he       thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals       in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the       less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich       he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and       perhaps agreeableâ\\x80\\x94allowing something for fortune and figure.â\\x80\\x9d        The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered       round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between       his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual enquiries as to       his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great;       he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express       her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity       that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the       money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make       herself uneasy.        â\\x80\\x9cI know very well, madam,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat when persons sit down       to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things,       and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five       shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not       say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am       removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s attention was caught; and after observing Mr.       Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice       whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the       family of de Bourgh.        â\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine de Bourgh,â\\x80\\x9d she replied, â\\x80\\x9chas very lately given       him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced       to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne       Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present       Mr. Darcy.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s       connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before       yesterday.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,       and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two       estates.â\\x80\\x9d        This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor       Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and       useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself,       if he were already self-destined for another.        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Collins,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine       and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related       of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that       in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant,       conceited woman.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI believe her to be both in a great degree,â\\x80\\x9d replied Wickham; â\\x80\\x9cI       have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I       never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and       insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and       clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities       from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,       and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that       everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the       first class.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of       it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction       till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies       their share of Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s attentions. There could be no       conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillipsâ\\x80\\x99s supper party, but       his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was       said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went       away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of       Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but       there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went,       for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked       incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the       fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of       Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least       regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper,       and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to       say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at       Longbourn House.     Chapter 17        Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between       Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and       concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so       unworthy of Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s regard; and yet, it was not in her       nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable       appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having endured such       unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and       nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them       both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account       of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.        â\\x80\\x9cThey have both,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cbeen deceived, I dare say, in some       way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people       have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short,       impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which       may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cVery true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to       say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been       concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be       obliged to think ill of somebody.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my       opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful       light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s favourite       in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide       for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had       any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most       intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI can much more easily believe Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s being imposed on,       than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as       he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without       ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides,       there was truth in his looks.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is difficult indeedâ\\x80\\x94it is distressing. One does not know what       to think.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.â\\x80\\x9d        But Jane could think with certainty on only one pointâ\\x80\\x94that Mr.       Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer       when the affair became public.        The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this       conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom       they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give       their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at       Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two       ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it       an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been       doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the       family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much       as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to       the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats       with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and       hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s civilities.        The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to       every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as       given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly       flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,       instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy       evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of       their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a       great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of       everything in Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s look and behaviour. The happiness       anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single       event, or any particular person, for though they each, like       Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he       was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a       ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her       family that she had no disinclination for it.        â\\x80\\x9cWhile I can have my mornings to myself,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cit is       enoughâ\\x80\\x94I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening       engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself       one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement       as desirable for everybody.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though       she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could       not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s       invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to       join in the eveningâ\\x80\\x99s amusement; and she was rather surprised to       find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and       was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,       or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.        â\\x80\\x9cI am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat a       ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to       respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far       from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be       honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of       the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,       Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference       which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause,       and not to any disrespect for her.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully       proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and       to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse       timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s happiness       and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr.       Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.       She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea       it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that       _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being       mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a       quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible       visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed       his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent       attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more       astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms,       it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the       probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_.       Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well       aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any       reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did,       it was useless to quarrel about him.        If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk       of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable       state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the       day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented       their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news       could be sought afterâ\\x80\\x94the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were       got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her       patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of       her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance       on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and       Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.     Chapter 18        Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and       looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats       there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred       to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any       of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed       her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in       the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained       unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might       be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the       dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s       pleasure in the Bingleysâ\\x80\\x99 invitation to the officers; and though       this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence       was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly       applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to       town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;       adding, with a significant smile, â\\x80\\x9cI do not imagine his business       would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to       avoid a certain gentleman here.â\\x80\\x9d        This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was       caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not       less answerable for Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s absence than if her first surmise       had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former       was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could       hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries       which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,       forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was       resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned       away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly       surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality       provoked her.        But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every       prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not       dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to       Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon       able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her       cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first       two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were       dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,       apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without       being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a       disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment       of her release from him was ecstasy.        She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of       talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.       When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and       was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly       addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his       application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she       accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left       to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to       console her:        â\\x80\\x9cI dare say you will find him very agreeable.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHeaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!       To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not       wish me such an evil.â\\x80\\x9d        When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to       claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a       whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham       to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his       consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the       set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being       allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her       neighboursâ\\x80\\x99 looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They       stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to       imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances,       and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying       that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige       him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He       replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she       addressed him a second time with:â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cIt is _your_ turn to say       something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_       ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the       number of couples.â\\x80\\x9d        He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say       should be said.        â\\x80\\x9cVery well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by       I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public       ones. But _now_ we may be silent.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDo you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cSometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd       to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the       advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as       that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAre you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do       you imagine that you are gratifying mine?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBoth,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth archly; â\\x80\\x9cfor I have always seen a great       similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,       taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say       something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to       posterity with all the _Ã©clat_ of a proverb.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThis is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am       sure,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cHow near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend       to say. _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI must not decide on my own performance.â\\x80\\x9d        He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone       down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not       very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and,       unable to resist the temptation, added, â\\x80\\x9cWhen you met us there       the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.â\\x80\\x9d        The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread       his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though       blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length       Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, â\\x80\\x9cMr. Wickham is       blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_       friendsâ\\x80\\x94whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is       less certain.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHe has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,â\\x80\\x9d replied       Elizabeth with emphasis, â\\x80\\x9cand in a manner which he is likely to       suffer from all his life.â\\x80\\x9d        Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the       subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to       them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the       room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of       superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his       partner.        â\\x80\\x9cI have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very       superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong       to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair       partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this       pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable       event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall       take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to       Mr. Darcy:â\\x80\\x94but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank       me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young       lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.â\\x80\\x9d        The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but       Sir Williamâ\\x80\\x99s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him       forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious       expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.       Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,       and said, â\\x80\\x9cSir Williamâ\\x80\\x99s interruption has made me forget what we       were talking of.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not       have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for       themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without       success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat think you of books?â\\x80\\x9d said he, smiling.        â\\x80\\x9cBooksâ\\x80\\x94oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the       same feelings.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at       least be no want of subject. We may compare our different       opinions.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full       of something else.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThe _present_ always occupies you in such scenesâ\\x80\\x94does it?â\\x80\\x9d said       he, with a look of doubt.        â\\x80\\x9cYes, always,â\\x80\\x9d she replied, without knowing what she said, for       her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon       afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, â\\x80\\x9cI remember       hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,       that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very       cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created?_â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am,â\\x80\\x9d said he, with a firm voice.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI hope not.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is particularly incumbent on those who never change their       opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMay I ask to what these questions tend?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMerely to the illustration of _your_ character,â\\x80\\x9d said she,       endeavouring to shake off her gravity. â\\x80\\x9cI am trying to make it       out.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd what is your success?â\\x80\\x9d        She shook her head. â\\x80\\x9cI do not get on at all. I hear such       different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI can readily believe,â\\x80\\x9d answered he gravely, â\\x80\\x9cthat reports may       vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,       that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,       as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no       credit on either.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another       opportunity.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,â\\x80\\x9d he coldly       replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and       parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to       an equal degree, for in Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s breast there was a tolerably       powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and       directed all his anger against another.        They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her,       and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:        â\\x80\\x9cSo, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George       Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking       me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite       forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was       the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s steward. Let me       recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit       confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s using him       ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always       been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated       Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the       particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the       least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham       mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not       well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he       was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the       way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,       indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,       Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favouriteâ\\x80\\x99s guilt; but       really, considering his descent, one could not expect much       better.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHis guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the       same,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth angrily; â\\x80\\x9cfor I have heard you accuse him       of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s steward,       and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a       sneer. â\\x80\\x9cExcuse my interferenceâ\\x80\\x94it was kindly meant.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cInsolent girl!â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth to herself. â\\x80\\x9cYou are much       mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as       this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the       malice of Mr. Darcy.â\\x80\\x9d She then sought her eldest sister, who had       undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane       met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such       happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was       satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth       instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for       Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else,       gave way before the hope of Janeâ\\x80\\x99s being in the fairest way for       happiness.        â\\x80\\x9cI want to know,â\\x80\\x9d said she, with a countenance no less smiling       than her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s, â\\x80\\x9cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But       perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any       third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d replied Jane, â\\x80\\x9cI have not forgotten him; but I have nothing       satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of       his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which       have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the       good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is       perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less       attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to       say by his account as well as his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s, Mr. Wickham is by no       means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very       imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s regard.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am       satisfied. But what does he say of the living?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has       heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it       was left to him _conditionally_ only.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s sincerity,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth       warmly; â\\x80\\x9cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances       only. Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s defense of his friend was a very able one, I       dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the       story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall       venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.â\\x80\\x9d        She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,       and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth       listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which       Jane entertained of Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s regard, and said all in her       power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by       Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose       enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had       scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told       her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as       to make a most important discovery.        â\\x80\\x9cI have found out,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cby a singular accident, that there       is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to       overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who       does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de       Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these       sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with,       perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I       am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay       my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will       excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the       connection must plead my apology.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it       earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s _nephew_. It will       be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well       yesterday seâ\\x80\\x99nnight.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring       him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without       introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment       to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should       be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong       to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the       acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air       of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,       replied thus:        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world       in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of       your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a       wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst       the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me       leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in       point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomâ\\x80\\x94provided       that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time       maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of       my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I       look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by       your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant       guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted       by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a       young lady like yourself.â\\x80\\x9d And with a low bow he left her to       attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly       watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very       evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and       though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it       all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words â\\x80\\x9capology,â\\x80\\x9d       â\\x80\\x9cHunsford,â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine de Bourgh.â\\x80\\x9d It vexed her to see       him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with       unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him       time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.       Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and       Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length       of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a       slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to       Elizabeth.        â\\x80\\x9cI have no reason, I assure you,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cto be dissatisfied       with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the       attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid       me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady       Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a       favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon       the whole, I am much pleased with him.â\\x80\\x9d        As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she       turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.       Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her       observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as       Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the       felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she       felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to       like Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s two sisters. Her motherâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts she plainly saw       were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near       her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,       therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which       placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to       find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)       freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane       would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating       subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while       enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a       charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from       them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was       such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,       and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as       she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her       younger daughters, as Janeâ\\x80\\x99s marrying so greatly must throw them       in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at       her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to       the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go       into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this       circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it       is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to       find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She       concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be       equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing       there was no chance of it.        In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her       motherâ\\x80\\x99s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a       less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she       could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy,       who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being       nonsensical.        â\\x80\\x9cWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I       am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged       to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cFor heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be       for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to       his friend by so doing!â\\x80\\x9d        Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her       mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.       Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She       could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though       every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was       not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his       attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face       changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and       steady gravity.        At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady       Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights       which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts       of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not       long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,       singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing       Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the       company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she       endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;       Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting       was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s eyes       were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched       her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which       was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,       amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she       might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of       half a minute began another. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s powers were by no means       fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner       affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see       how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.       She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of       derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,       imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his       interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the       hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,       â\\x80\\x9cThat will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long       enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.â\\x80\\x9d        Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;       and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s speech,       was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were       now applied to.        â\\x80\\x9cIf I,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Collins, â\\x80\\x9cwere so fortunate as to be able to       sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the       company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent       diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a       clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be       justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there       are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a       parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an       agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not       offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the       time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and       the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be       excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not       think it of light importance that he should have attentive and       conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those       to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;       nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of       testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the       family.â\\x80\\x9d And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,       which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.       Many staredâ\\x80\\x94many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.       Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins       for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to       Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young       man.        To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement       to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it       would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more       spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley       and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his       notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much       distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his       two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an       opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she       could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman,       or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.        The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was       teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her       side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him       again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did       she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to       introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that       as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief       object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and       that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her       the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She       owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often       joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s       conversation to herself.        She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s further       notice; though often standing within a very short distance of       her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She       felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.       Wickham, and rejoiced in it.        The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,       and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their       carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,       which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by       some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened       their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently       impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every       attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a       languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by       the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr.       Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment,       and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their       behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet,       in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane       were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and       talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a       silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was       too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation       of â\\x80\\x9cLord, how tired I am!â\\x80\\x9d accompanied by a violent yawn.        When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most       pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at       Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to       assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner       with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal       invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily       engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,       after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the       next day for a short time.        Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under       the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary       preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,       she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in       the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter       married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and       with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the       least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the       match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was       eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.     Chapter 19        The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made       his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of       time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following       Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it       distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a       very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed       a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet,       Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after       breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:        â\\x80\\x9cMay I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter       Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience       with her in the course of this morning?â\\x80\\x9d        Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,       Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, â\\x80\\x9cOh dear!â\\x80\\x94yesâ\\x80\\x94certainly. I am       sure Lizzy will be very happyâ\\x80\\x94I am sure she can have no       objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.â\\x80\\x9d And, gathering her       work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:        â\\x80\\x9cDear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must       excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not       hear. I am going away myself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.â\\x80\\x9d       And upon Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed       looks, about to escape, she added: â\\x80\\x9cLizzy, I _insist_ upon your       staying and hearing Mr. Collins.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionâ\\x80\\x94and a momentâ\\x80\\x99s       consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to       get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down       again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings       which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet       and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins       began.        â\\x80\\x9cBelieve me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far       from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other       perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had       there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to       assure you, that I have your respected motherâ\\x80\\x99s permission for       this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,       however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my       attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as       I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my       future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this       subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons       for marryingâ\\x80\\x94and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with       the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.â\\x80\\x9d        The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run       away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that       she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to       stop him further, and he continued:        â\\x80\\x9cMy reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right       thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to       set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am       convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and       thirdlyâ\\x80\\x94which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it       is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble       lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she       condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this       subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left       Hunsfordâ\\x80\\x94between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was       arranging Miss de Bourghâ\\x80\\x99s footstool, that she said, â\\x80\\x98Mr.       Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose       properly, choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_,       let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high,       but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice.       Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and       I will visit her.â\\x80\\x99 Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair       cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady       Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my       power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can       describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable       to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect       which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general       intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my       views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own       neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable       young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit       this estate after the death of your honoured father (who,       however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself       without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that       the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the       melancholy event takes placeâ\\x80\\x94which, however, as I have already       said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my       fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your       esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection. To       fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of       that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could       not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four       per cents, which will not be yours till after your motherâ\\x80\\x99s       decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,       therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when       we are married.â\\x80\\x9d        It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.        â\\x80\\x9cYou are too hasty, sir,â\\x80\\x9d she cried. â\\x80\\x9cYou forget that I have made       no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my       thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible       of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to       do otherwise than to decline them.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am not now to learn,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave       of the hand, â\\x80\\x9cthat it is usual with young ladies to reject the       addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he       first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is       repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no       means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to       lead you to the altar ere long.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, sir,â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cyour hope is a rather       extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am       not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)       who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of       being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.       You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the       last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your       friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find       me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWere it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr.       Collins very gravelyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cbut I cannot imagine that her ladyship       would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I       have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very       highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable       qualification.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You       must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment       of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and       by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being       otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the       delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take       possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any       self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as       finally settled.â\\x80\\x9d And rising as she thus spoke, she would have       quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:        â\\x80\\x9cWhen I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the       subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than       you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of       cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established       custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and       perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as       would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female       character.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cReally, Mr. Collins,â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth with some warmth, â\\x80\\x9cyou       puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to       you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my       refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that       your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My       reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to       me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the       establishment I can offer would be any other than highly       desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family       of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances       highly in my favour; and you should take it into further       consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is       by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be       made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all       likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable       qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not       serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it       to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the       usual practice of elegant females.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to       that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable       man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed       sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done       me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely       impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak       plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending       to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth       from her heart.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are uniformly charming!â\\x80\\x9d cried he, with an air of awkward       gallantry; â\\x80\\x9cand I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the       express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals       will not fail of being acceptable.â\\x80\\x9d        To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would       make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew;       determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals       as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose       negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and       whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the       affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.     Chapter 20        Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his       successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the       vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw       Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the       staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated       both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their       nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these       felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate       the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he       trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal       which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow       from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her       character.        This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have       been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to       encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared       not believe it, and could not help saying so.        â\\x80\\x9cBut, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cthat Lizzy shall       be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She       is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own       interest but I will _make_ her know it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPardon me for interrupting you, madam,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Collins; â\\x80\\x9cbut       if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she       would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my       situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage       state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,       perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,       because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not       contribute much to my felicity.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cSir, you quite misunderstand me,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.       â\\x80\\x9cLizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything       else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go       directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with       her, I am sure.â\\x80\\x9d        She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to       her husband, called out as she entered the library, â\\x80\\x9cOh! Mr.       Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You       must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will       not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his       mind and not have _her_.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and       fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the       least altered by her communication.        â\\x80\\x9cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,â\\x80\\x9d said he, when she       had finished her speech. â\\x80\\x9cOf what are you talking?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.       Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have       Lizzy.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless       business.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon       her marrying him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the       library.        â\\x80\\x9cCome here, child,â\\x80\\x9d cried her father as she appeared. â\\x80\\x9cI have       sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr.       Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?â\\x80\\x9d Elizabeth       replied that it was. â\\x80\\x9cVery wellâ\\x80\\x94and this offer of marriage you       have refused?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have, sir.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon       your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, or I will never see her again.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day       you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will       never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will       never see you again if you _do_.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a       beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her       husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively       disappointed.        â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised       me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear,â\\x80\\x9d replied her husband, â\\x80\\x9cI have two small favours to       request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my       understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.       I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.â\\x80\\x9d        Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,       did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again       and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to       secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible       mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with       real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to       her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination       never did.        Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had       passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what       motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was       hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite       imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her motherâ\\x80\\x99s       reproach prevented his feeling any regret.        While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to       spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,       who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, â\\x80\\x9cI am glad you are       come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened       this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she       will not have him.â\\x80\\x9d        Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by       Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they       entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she       likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her       compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to       comply with the wishes of all her family. â\\x80\\x9cPray do, my dear Miss       Lucas,â\\x80\\x9d she added in a melancholy tone, â\\x80\\x9cfor nobody is on my       side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels       for my poor nerves.â\\x80\\x9d        Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and       Elizabeth.        â\\x80\\x9cAye, there she comes,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Bennet, â\\x80\\x9clooking as       unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were       at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss       Lizzyâ\\x80\\x94if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer       of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at allâ\\x80\\x94and       I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father       is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep youâ\\x80\\x94and so I warn you. I       have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library,       you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will       find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to       undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in       talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous       complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can       tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not       complain are never pitied.â\\x80\\x9d        Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that       any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase       the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption       from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who       entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on       perceiving whom, she said to the girls, â\\x80\\x9cNow, I do insist upon       it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr.       Collins have a little conversation together.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty       followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she       could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.       Collins, whose enquiries after herself and all her family were       very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself       with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a       doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: â\\x80\\x9cOh!       Mr. Collins!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear madam,â\\x80\\x9d replied he, â\\x80\\x9clet us be for ever silent on this       point. Far be it from me,â\\x80\\x9d he presently continued, in a voice       that marked his displeasure, â\\x80\\x9cto resent the behaviour of your       daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all;       the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I       have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps       not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had       my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often       observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the       blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our       estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any       disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my       pretensions to your daughterâ\\x80\\x99s favour, without having paid       yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to       interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be       objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your       daughterâ\\x80\\x99s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to       error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My       object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with       due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my       _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to       apologise.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 21        The discussion of Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s offer was now nearly at an end,       and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings       necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish       allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_       feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or       dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner       and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the       assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself       were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose       civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all,       and especially to her friend.        The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s ill-humour or       ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry       pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his       visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.       He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant       to stay.        After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Mr.       Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the       Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and       attended them to their auntâ\\x80\\x99s where his regret and vexation, and       the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth,       however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his       absence _had_ been self-imposed.        â\\x80\\x9cI found,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cas the time drew near that I had better not       meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with       him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear,       and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.â\\x80\\x9d        She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a       full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they       civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer       walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he       particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double       advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and       it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her       father and mother.        Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet;       it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of       elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a ladyâ\\x80\\x99s       fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s countenance       change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some       particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting       the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the       general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the       subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no       sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from       Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained       their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:        â\\x80\\x9cThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me       a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time,       and are on their way to townâ\\x80\\x94and without any intention of coming       back again. You shall hear what she says.â\\x80\\x9d        She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the       information of their having just resolved to follow their brother       to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor       Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:       â\\x80\\x9cI do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in       Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we       will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that       delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may       lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most       unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.â\\x80\\x9d To these       highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the       insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their       removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it       was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would       prevent Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s being there; and as to the loss of their       society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in       the enjoyment of his.        â\\x80\\x9cIt is unlucky,â\\x80\\x9d said she, after a short pause, â\\x80\\x9cthat you should       not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.       But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which       Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware,       and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends       will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr.       Bingley will not be detained in London by them.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCaroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into       Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhen my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business       which took him to London might be concluded in three or four       days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time       convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry       to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither,       that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a       comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for       the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend,       had any intention of making one of the crowdâ\\x80\\x94but of that I       despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may       abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and       that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling       the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is evident by this,â\\x80\\x9d added Jane, â\\x80\\x9cthat he comes back no more       this winter.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he       _should_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhy will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own       master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage       which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the       truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really       do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,       and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and       myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from       the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I       do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on       this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding       them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My       brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent       opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her       relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a       sisterâ\\x80\\x99s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call       Charles most capable of engaging any womanâ\\x80\\x99s heart. With all       these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to       prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of       an event which will secure the happiness of so many?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?â\\x80\\x9d said Jane       as she finished it. â\\x80\\x9cIs it not clear enough? Does it not       expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to       be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s       indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings       for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can       there be any other opinion on the subject?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear       it?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMost willingly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her       brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.       She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries       to persuade you that he does not care about you.â\\x80\\x9d        Jane shook her head.        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen       you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure,       cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as       much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her       wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or       grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss       Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been       _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a       second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare       say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,       my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss       Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is       in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he       took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to       persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very       much in love with her friend.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf we thought alike of Miss Bingley,â\\x80\\x9d replied Jane, â\\x80\\x9cyour       representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know       the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully       deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that       she is deceiving herself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is right. You could not have started a more happy idea,       since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be       deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and       must fret no longer.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in       accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to       marry elsewhere?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou must decide for yourself,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cand if, upon       mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his       two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his       wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow can you talk so?â\\x80\\x9d said Jane, faintly smiling. â\\x80\\x9cYou must know       that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their       disapprobation, I could not hesitate.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot       consider your situation with much compassion.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be       required. A thousand things may arise in six months!â\\x80\\x9d        The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the       utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of       Carolineâ\\x80\\x99s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment       suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,       could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.        She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she       felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its       happy effect. Janeâ\\x80\\x99s temper was not desponding, and she was       gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection       sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to       Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.        They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of       the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s       conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great       deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that       the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting       so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some       length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon       down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of       all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been       invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two       full courses.     Chapter 22        The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again       during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen       to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.       â\\x80\\x9cIt keeps him in good humour,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cand I am more obliged       to you than I can express.â\\x80\\x9d Charlotte assured her friend of her       satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for       the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but       Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any       conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her       from any return of Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s addresses, by engaging them       towards herself. Such was Miss Lucasâ\\x80\\x99s scheme; and appearances       were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would       have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave       Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the       fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape       out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness,       and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was       anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction       that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture       his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till       its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost       secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably       encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure       of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering       kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked       towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally       in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love       and eloquence awaited her there.        In as short a time as Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s long speeches would allow,       everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;       and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name       the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such       a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no       inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with       which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any       charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss       Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested       desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment       were gained.        Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their       consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr.       Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for       their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his       prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas       began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter       had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was       likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion,       that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the       Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and       his wife should make their appearance at St. Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s. The whole       family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The       younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner       than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved       from their apprehension of Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s dying an old maid.       Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her       point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in       general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither       sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his       attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her       husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,       marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision       for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however       uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest       preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained;       and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been       handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable       circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to       Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any       other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame       her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings       must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her       the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when       he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had       passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of       course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without       difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst       forth in such very direct questions on his return as required       some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising       great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous       love.        As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any       of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when       the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great       politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see       him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him       to visit them.        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear madam,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cthis invitation is particularly       gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and       you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon       as possible.â\\x80\\x9d        They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means       wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:        â\\x80\\x9cBut is there not danger of Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s disapprobation here,       my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the       risk of offending your patroness.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear sir,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Collins, â\\x80\\x9cI am particularly obliged to       you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not       taking so material a step without her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s concurrence.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather       than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by       your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly       probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall       take no offence.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBelieve me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such       affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily       receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other       mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my       fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render       it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health       and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.â\\x80\\x9d        With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them       equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet       wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his       addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been       prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher       than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections       which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as       herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve       himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very       agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of       this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast,       and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of       the day before.        The possibility of Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s fancying himself in love with       her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or       two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far       from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her       astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first       the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:        â\\x80\\x9cEngaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotteâ\\x80\\x94impossible!â\\x80\\x9d        The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling       her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so       direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected,       she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:        â\\x80\\x9cWhy should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it       incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any womanâ\\x80\\x99s       good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with       you?â\\x80\\x9d        But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong       effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that       the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her,       and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.        â\\x80\\x9cI see what you are feeling,â\\x80\\x9d replied Charlotte. â\\x80\\x9cYou must be       surprised, very much surprisedâ\\x80\\x94so lately as Mr. Collins was       wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it       over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am       not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable       home; and considering Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s character, connection, and       situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness       with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the       marriage state.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth quietly answered â\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly;â\\x80\\x9d and after an awkward       pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not       stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what       she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all       reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness       of Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s making two offers of marriage within three days       was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had       always felt that Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s opinion of matrimony was not exactly       like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,       when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better       feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins       was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend       disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the       distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to       be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.     Chapter 23        Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on       what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to       mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his       daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many       compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of       a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matterâ\\x80\\x94to an       audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet,       with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be       entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil,       boisterously exclaimed:        â\\x80\\x9cGood Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not       you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?â\\x80\\x9d        Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne       without anger such treatment; but Sir Williamâ\\x80\\x99s good breeding       carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be       positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all       their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.        Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so       unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his       account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte       herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her       mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to       Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by       making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be       expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,       and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.        Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal       while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than       her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she       persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she       was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she       trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,       that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were       plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real       cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been       barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she       principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could       console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out       her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth       without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak       to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months       were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.        Mr. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,       and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most       agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that       Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably       sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his       daughter!        Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she       said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for       their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it       as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,       for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no       other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.        Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to       retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well       married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to       say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s sour looks and       ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness       away.        Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept       them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded       that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.       Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard       to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her       opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew       daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and       nothing more was heard of his return.        Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was       counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.       The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on       Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the       solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonthâ\\x80\\x99s abode in the family       might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that       head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous       expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of       their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it       was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been       so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at       Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday       fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his       marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,       which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his       amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the       happiest of men.        Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of       pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much       disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange       that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it       was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated       having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent,       and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were       the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the       greater distress of Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s continued absence.        Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day       after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him       than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming       no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly       incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as       a most scandalous falsehood.        Even Elizabeth began to fearâ\\x80\\x94not that Bingley was indifferentâ\\x80\\x94but       that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.       Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Janeâ\\x80\\x99s       happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she       could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of       his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend,       assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of       London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his       attachment.        As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course,       more painful than Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s, but whatever she felt she was       desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,       therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such       delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which       she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his       arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come       back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Janeâ\\x80\\x99s       steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable       tranquillity.        Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his       reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been       on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need       much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of       love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The       chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he       sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology       for his absence before the family went to bed.        Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention       of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of       ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it       talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her       successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous       abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded       her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she       spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were       talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself       and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were       dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cit is very hard to think that       Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_       should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take       her place in it!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope       for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the       survivor.â\\x80\\x9d        This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,       instead of making any answer, she went on as before.        â\\x80\\x9cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If       it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat should not you mind?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI should not mind anything at all.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such       insensibility.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the       entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an       estate from oneâ\\x80\\x99s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for       the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he_ have it more than       anybody else?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI leave it to yourself to determine,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet.     Chapter 24        Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very       first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled       in London for the winter, and concluded with her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s regret       at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in       Hertfordshire before he left the country.        Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the       rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed       affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss       Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions       were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their       increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment       of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She       wrote also with great pleasure of her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s being an inmate       of Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of       the latter with regard to new furniture.        Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all       this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided       between concern for her sister, and resentment against all       others. To Carolineâ\\x80\\x99s assertion of her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s being partial to       Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane,       she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had       always been disposed to like him, she could not think without       anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that       want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his       designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness       to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness,       however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to       sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her       sisterâ\\x80\\x99s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible       himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be       long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing       else; and yet whether Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s regard had really died away, or       were suppressed by his friendsâ\\x80\\x99 interference; whether he had been       aware of Janeâ\\x80\\x99s attachment, or whether it had escaped his       observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him       must be materially affected by the difference, her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s       situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.        A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her       feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s leaving them       together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield       and its master, she could not help saying:        â\\x80\\x9cOh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can       have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual       reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long.       He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but       said nothing.        â\\x80\\x9cYou doubt me,â\\x80\\x9d cried Jane, slightly colouring; â\\x80\\x9cindeed, you have       no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my       acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or       fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not       _that_ pain. A little time, thereforeâ\\x80\\x94I shall certainly try to       get the better.â\\x80\\x9d        With a stronger voice she soon added, â\\x80\\x9cI have this comfort       immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on       my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Jane!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cyou are too good. Your       sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know       what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or       loved you as you deserve.â\\x80\\x9d        Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw       back the praise on her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s warm affection.        â\\x80\\x9cNay,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cthis is not fair. _You_ wish to think all       the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.       _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself       against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my       encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need       not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of       whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I       dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the       inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little       dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or       sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not       mention; the other is Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s marriage. It is unaccountable!       In every view it is unaccountable!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They       will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for       difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s       respectability, and Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s steady, prudent character.       Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune,       it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for       everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s sake, that she may feel something like regard and       esteem for our cousin.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no       one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I       persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only       think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My       dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,       silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as       well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper       way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte       Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the       meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade       yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility       of danger security for happiness.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI must think your language too strong in speaking of both,â\\x80\\x9d       replied Jane; â\\x80\\x9cand I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing       them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something       else. You mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you,       but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that       person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must       not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must       not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and       circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that       deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd men take care that they should.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have       no idea of there being so much design in the world as some       persons imagine.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s conduct to       design,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cbut without scheming to do wrong, or to       make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.       Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s feelings,       and want of resolution, will do the business.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd do you impute it to either of those?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by       saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you       can.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, in conjunction with his friend.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They       can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no       other woman can secure it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour first position is false. They may wish many things besides       his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and       consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the       importance of money, great connections, and pride.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBeyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,â\\x80\\x9d replied       Jane; â\\x80\\x9cbut this may be from better feelings than you are       supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known       me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their       own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their       brotherâ\\x80\\x99s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it,       unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed       him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so,       they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make       everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do       not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been       mistakenâ\\x80\\x94or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison       of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let       me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be       understood.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.       Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.        Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning       no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did       not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever       considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to       convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his       attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and       transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but       though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,       she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s best       comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.        Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. â\\x80\\x9cSo, Lizzy,â\\x80\\x9d said he       one day, â\\x80\\x9cyour sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate       her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little       in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives       her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn       to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is       your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all       the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a       pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We       must not all expect Janeâ\\x80\\x99s good fortune.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTrue,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, â\\x80\\x9cbut it is a comfort to think that       whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate       mother who will make the most of it.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s society was of material service in dispelling the       gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of       the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other       recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The       whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr.       Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly       acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to       know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had       known anything of the matter.        Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might       be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the       society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always       pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakesâ\\x80\\x94but       by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.     Chapter 25        After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of       felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by       the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might       be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of       his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his       return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to       make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at       Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair       cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father       another letter of thanks.        On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of       receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend       the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,       gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by       nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had       difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within       view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and       agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.       Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant       woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.       Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a       particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in       town.        The first part of Mrs. Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s business on her arrival was to       distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When       this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her       turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and       much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she       last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of       marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.        â\\x80\\x9cI do not blame Jane,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, â\\x80\\x9cfor Jane would have got       Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard       to think that she might have been Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s wife by this       time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an       offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of       it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I       have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as       ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are       all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so       it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in       my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves       before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is       the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you       tell us, of long sleeves.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given       before, in the course of Jane and Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s correspondence with       her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her       nieces, turned the conversation.        When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the       subject. â\\x80\\x9cIt seems likely to have been a desirable match for       Jane,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cI am sorry it went off. But these things happen       so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so       easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when       accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort       of inconsistencies are very frequent.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAn excellent consolation in its way,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cbut it       will not do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not       often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a       young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom       he was violently in love with only a few days before.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut that expression of â\\x80\\x98violently in loveâ\\x80\\x99 is so hackneyed, so       doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is       as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hourâ\\x80\\x99s       acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent       was_ Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s love?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite       inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every       time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own       ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to       dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an       answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility       the very essence of love?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes!â\\x80\\x94of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.       Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she       may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to       _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.       But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?       Change of scene might be of serviceâ\\x80\\x94and perhaps a little relief       from home may be as useful as anything.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt       persuaded of her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s ready acquiescence.        â\\x80\\x9cI hope,â\\x80\\x9d added Mrs. Gardiner, â\\x80\\x9cthat no consideration with regard       to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a       part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you       well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that       they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of       his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on       Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think       of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as       Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a monthâ\\x80\\x99s ablution       enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter       it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cSo much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does       not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to       help calling.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe will drop the acquaintance entirely.â\\x80\\x9d        But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to       place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of       Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude       on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did       not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes       she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated,       and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the       more natural influence of Janeâ\\x80\\x99s attractions.        Miss Bennet accepted her auntâ\\x80\\x99s invitation with pleasure; and the       Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than       as she hoped by Carolineâ\\x80\\x99s not living in the same house with her       brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without       any danger of seeing him.        The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the       Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day       without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for       the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not       once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for       home, some of the officers always made part of itâ\\x80\\x94of which       officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,       Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s warm       commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing       them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their       preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little       uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject       before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the       imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.        To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,       unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years       ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in       that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had,       therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had       been little there since the death of Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s father, it was yet       in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former       friends than she had been in the way of procuring.        Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by       character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible       subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley       with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in       bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late       possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made       acquainted with the present Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s treatment of him, she       tried to remember some of that gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s reputed disposition       when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at       last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy       formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.     Chapter 26        Mrs. Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly       given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her       alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went       on:        â\\x80\\x9cYou are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely       because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not       afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your       guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an       affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.       I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting       young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should       think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let       your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect       you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and       good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWell, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of       myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me,       if I can prevent it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cElizabeth, you are not serious now.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love       with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all       comparison, the most agreeable man I ever sawâ\\x80\\x94and if he becomes       really attached to meâ\\x80\\x94I believe it will be better that he should       not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!       My fatherâ\\x80\\x99s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I       should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial       to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to       be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every       day that where there is affection, young people are seldom       withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into       engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than       so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even       to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise       you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry       to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with       him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so       very often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of       inviting him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAs I did the other day,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:       â\\x80\\x9cvery true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do       not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your       account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You       know my motherâ\\x80\\x99s ideas as to the necessity of constant company       for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do       what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.â\\x80\\x9d        Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked       her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful       instance of advice being given on such a point, without being       resented.        Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been       quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode       with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.       Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at       length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even       repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she â\\x80\\x9c_wished_       they might be happy.â\\x80\\x9d Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on       Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose       to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her motherâ\\x80\\x99s ungracious and       reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,       accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs       together, Charlotte said:        â\\x80\\x9cI shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9c_That_ you certainly shall.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me,       therefore, to come to Hunsford.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in       the visit.        â\\x80\\x9cMy father and Maria are coming to me in March,â\\x80\\x9d added Charlotte,       â\\x80\\x9cand I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza,       you will be as welcome as either of them.â\\x80\\x9d        The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent       from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to       hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her       friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as       it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was       impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling       that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined       not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what       had been, rather than what was. Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s first letters were       received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be       curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she       would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce       herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt       that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she       might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with       comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The       house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her       taste, and Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour was most friendly and       obliging. It was Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s picture of Hunsford and Rosings       rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait       for her own visit there to know the rest.        Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce       their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth       hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.        Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as       impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without       either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it,       however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from       Longbourn had by some accident been lost.        â\\x80\\x9cMy aunt,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, â\\x80\\x9cis going to-morrow into that part of       the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in       Grosvenor Street.â\\x80\\x9d        She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss       Bingley. â\\x80\\x9cI did not think Caroline in spirits,â\\x80\\x9d were her words,       â\\x80\\x9cbut she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving       her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my       last letter had never reached her. I enquired after their       brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.       Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy       was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not       long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I       shall see them soon here.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that       accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s being in       town.        Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She       endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but       she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s inattention. After       waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing       every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last       appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the       alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no       longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister       will prove what she felt.        â\\x80\\x9cMy dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in       her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to       have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s regard for me. But,       my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not       think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her       behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I       do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate       with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am       sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit       till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the       meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no       pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not       calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and       was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went       away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no       longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very       wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every       advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am       very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need       not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to       be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account       for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his       sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural       and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such       fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have       met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from       something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner       of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is       really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were       not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say       that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I       will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of       what will make me happyâ\\x80\\x94your affection, and the invariable       kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very       soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to       Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any       certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that       you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.       Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you       will be very comfortable there.â\\x80\\x94Yours, etc.â\\x80\\x9d        This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as       she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister       at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely       over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.       His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for       him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped       he might really soon marry Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s sister, as by Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s       account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown       away.        Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise       concerning that gentleman, and required information; and       Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to       her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided,       his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.       Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it       and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but       slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing       that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted       it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most       remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering       himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in       this case than in Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s, did not quarrel with him for his       wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more       natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few       struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and       desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him       happy.        All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating       the circumstances, she thus went on: â\\x80\\x9cI am now convinced, my dear       aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really       experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present       detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my       feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even       impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at       all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good       sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness       has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more       interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in       love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative       insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.       Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.       They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the       mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something       to live on as well as the plain.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 27        With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and       otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,       sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass       away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at       first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she       soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned       to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater       certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte       again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty       in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such       uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little       change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would       moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew       near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,       however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to       Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and       his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in       London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan       could be.        The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss       her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her       going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to       answer her letter.        The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly       friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not       make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and       to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the       first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu,       wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to       expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of       herâ\\x80\\x94their opinion of everybodyâ\\x80\\x94would always coincide, there was a       solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to       him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced       that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of       the amiable and pleasing.        Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her       think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter       Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had       nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to       with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth       loved absurdities, but she had known Sir Williamâ\\x80\\x99s too long. He       could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and       knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his       information.        It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so       early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to       Mr. Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching       their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to       welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was       pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs       were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their       cousinâ\\x80\\x99s appearance would not allow them to wait in the       drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a       twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and       kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in       bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.        Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object       was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear,       in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always       struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of       dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would       not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of       Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated       conversations occurring at different times between Jane and       herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given       up the acquaintance.        Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s desertion, and       complimented her on bearing it so well.        â\\x80\\x9cBut my dear Elizabeth,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cwhat sort of girl is Miss       King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial       affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does       discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid       of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now,       because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds,       you want to find out that he is mercenary.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall       know what to think.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of       her.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut he paid her not the smallest attention till her       grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s death made her mistress of this fortune.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_       affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be       for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was       equally poor?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions       towards her so soon after this event.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cA man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those       elegant decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does       not object to it, why should _we_?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9c_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her       being deficient in something herselfâ\\x80\\x94sense or feeling.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9chave it as you choose. _He_ shall be       mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry,       you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in       Derbyshire.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who       live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in       Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank       Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not       one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to       recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after       all.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTake care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of       disappointment.â\\x80\\x9d        Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had       the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle       and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the       summer.        â\\x80\\x9cWe have not determined how far it shall carry us,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.       Gardiner, â\\x80\\x9cbut, perhaps, to the Lakes.â\\x80\\x9d        No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her       acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. â\\x80\\x9cOh, my       dear, dear aunt,â\\x80\\x9d she rapturously cried, â\\x80\\x9cwhat delight! what       felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to       disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and       mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when       we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without       being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know       where we have goneâ\\x80\\x94we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes,       mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our       imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular       scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let       _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the       generality of travellers.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 28        Every object in the next dayâ\\x80\\x99s journey was new and interesting to       Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she       had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her       health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant       source of delight.        When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye       was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to       bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary       on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she       had heard of its inhabitants.        At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to       the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the       laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins       and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at       the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house,       amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they       were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.       Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and       Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found       herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her       cousinâ\\x80\\x99s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal       civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some       minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all       her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing       out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as       soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time,       with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually       repeated all his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s offers of refreshment.        Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not       help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the       room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself       particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had       lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and       comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of       repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she       could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.       Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be       ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily       turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a       faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After       sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the       room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of       their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.       Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was       large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he       attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most       respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of       countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of       the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.       Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and       scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked       for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left       beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every       direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most       distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which       the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with       the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that       bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was       a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.        From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two       meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the       remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William       accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the       house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity       of showing it without her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s help. It was rather small,       but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and       arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave       Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten,       there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by       Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must       be often forgotten.        She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the       country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when       Mr. Collins joining in, observed:        â\\x80\\x9cYes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady       Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need       not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and       condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some       portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any       hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in       every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.       Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at       Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her       ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I _should_ say,       one of her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s carriages, for she has several.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,â\\x80\\x9d       added Charlotte, â\\x80\\x9cand a most attentive neighbour.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cVery true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort       of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.â\\x80\\x9d        The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,       and telling again what had already been written; and when it       closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to       meditate upon Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s degree of contentment, to understand       her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her       husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She       had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor       of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.       Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A       lively imagination soon settled it all.        About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting       ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole       house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard       somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly       after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing       place, who, breathless with agitation, cried outâ\\x80\\x94        â\\x80\\x9cOh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the       dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not       tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing       more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the       lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a       low phaeton at the garden gate.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd is this all?â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cI expected at least that the       pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady       Catherine and her daughter.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLa! my dear,â\\x80\\x9d said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, â\\x80\\x9cit is       not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives       with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is       quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be       so thin and small?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all       this wind. Why does she not come in?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of       favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI like her appearance,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.       â\\x80\\x9cShe looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well.       She will make him a very proper wife.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in       conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s       high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest       contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing       whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.        At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,       and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw       the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good       fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the       whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.     Chapter 29        Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was       complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness       to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility       towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for;       and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was       such an instance of Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s condescension, as he knew       not how to admire enough.        â\\x80\\x9cI confess,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat I should not have been at all       surprised by her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and       spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my       knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could       have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined       that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an       invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately       after your arrival!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am the less surprised at what has happened,â\\x80\\x9d replied Sir       William, â\\x80\\x9cfrom that knowledge of what the manners of the great       really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.       About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not       uncommon.â\\x80\\x9d        Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but       their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing       them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,       so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly       overpower them.        When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to       Elizabethâ\\x80\\x94        â\\x80\\x9cDo not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.       Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us       which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely       to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restâ\\x80\\x94there       is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think       the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the       distinction of rank preserved.â\\x80\\x9d        While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their       different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady       Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.       Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of       living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to       company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings       with as much apprehension as her father had done to his       presentation at St. Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s.        As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a       mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its       prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she       could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene       to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of       the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the       glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.        When they ascended the steps to the hall, Mariaâ\\x80\\x99s alarm was every       moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly       calm. Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing       of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary       talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money       or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.        From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a       rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,       they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room       where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were       sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive       them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that       the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a       proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he       would have thought necessary.        In spite of having been at St. Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s, Sir William was so       completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but       just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat       without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of       her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way       to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and       could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady       Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,       which might once have been handsome. Her air was not       conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to       make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not       rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken       in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and       brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s mind; and from the       observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to       be exactly what he represented.        When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and       deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she       turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in       Mariaâ\\x80\\x99s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was       neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss       de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain,       were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low       voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing       remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she       said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her       eyes.        After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the       windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point       out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that       it was much better worth looking at in the summer.        The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the       servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had       promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at       the bottom of the table, by her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s desire, and looked as       if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,       and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was       commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now       enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a       manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But       Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,       and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the       table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much       conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an       opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de       Bourghâ\\x80\\x94the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady       Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.       Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss       de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing       she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,       and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.        When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to       be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without       any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on       every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not       used to have her judgement controverted. She enquired into       Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a       great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her       how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as       hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her       poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great       ladyâ\\x80\\x99s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of       dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.       Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and       Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she       knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very       genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times,       how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than       herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether       they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage       her father kept, and what had been her motherâ\\x80\\x99s maiden name?       Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered       them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,        â\\x80\\x9cYour fatherâ\\x80\\x99s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For       your sake,â\\x80\\x9d turning to Charlotte, â\\x80\\x9cI am glad of it; but otherwise       I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It       was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourghâ\\x80\\x99s family. Do you       play and sing, Miss Bennet?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cA little.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! thenâ\\x80\\x94some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our       instrument is a capital one, probably superior toâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94You shall try       it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOne of them does.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhy did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The       Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income       as yours. Do you draw?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, not at all.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat, none of you?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNot one.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your       mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit       of masters.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy mother would have had no objection, but my father hates       London.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHas your governess left you?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe never had any governess.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up       at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your       mother must have been quite a slave to your education.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had       not been the case.        â\\x80\\x9cThen, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess,       you must have been neglected.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCompared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us       as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always       encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.       Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if       I had known your mother, I should have advised her most       strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be       done in education without steady and regular instruction, and       nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many       families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am       always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of       Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means;       and it was but the other day that I recommended another young       person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the       family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you       of Lady Metcalfâ\\x80\\x99s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss       Pope a treasure. â\\x80\\x98Lady Catherine,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98you have given me a       treasure.â\\x80\\x99 Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, maâ\\x80\\x99am, all.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAll! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the       second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!       Your younger sisters must be very young?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to       be much in company. But really, maâ\\x80\\x99am, I think it would be very       hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share       of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the       means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a       right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back       on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to       promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word,â\\x80\\x9d said her ladyship, â\\x80\\x9cyou give your opinion very       decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWith three younger sisters grown up,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth,       smiling, â\\x80\\x9cyour ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.â\\x80\\x9d        Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct       answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature       who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.        â\\x80\\x9cYou cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need       not conceal your age.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am not one-and-twenty.â\\x80\\x9d        When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the       card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and       Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose       to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting       Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was       superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did       not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her       fears of Miss de Bourghâ\\x80\\x99s being too hot or too cold, or having       too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the       other table. Lady Catherine was generally speakingâ\\x80\\x94stating the       mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of       herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her       ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and       apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not       say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble       names.        When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they       chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to       Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The       party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine       determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From       these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the       coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s       side and as many bows on Sir Williamâ\\x80\\x99s they departed. As soon as       they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her       cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings,       which, for Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s sake, she made more favourable than it       really was. But her commendation, though costing her some       trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very       soon obliged to take her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s praise into his own hands.     Chapter 30        Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was       long enough to convince him of his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s being most       comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and       such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William       was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out       in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away,       the whole family returned to their usual employments, and       Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her       cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between       breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the       garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window       in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which       the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather       wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for       common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant       aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason       for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been       much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally       lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.        From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,       and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what       carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh       drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform       them of, though it happened almost every day. She not       unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutesâ\\x80\\x99       conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon       to get out.        Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to       Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it       necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that       there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could       not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they       were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped       her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.       She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and       advised them to do it differently; found fault with the       arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in       negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it       only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s joints of       meat were too large for her family.        Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in       the commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active       magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were       carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers       were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she       sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,       silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.        The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a       week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being       only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was       the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few,       as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond       Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and       upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were       half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the       weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great       enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she       frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine,       was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where       there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but       herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s       curiosity.        In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed       away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to       bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a       circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her       arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few       weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom       she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively       new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused       in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s designs on him were, by his       behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by       Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest       satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration,       and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been       frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.        His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was       walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into       Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and       after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park,       hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following       morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were       two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had       brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his       uncle Lord â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when       Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte       had seen them from her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s room, crossing the road, and       immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour       they might expect, adding:        â\\x80\\x9cI may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy       would never have come so soon to wait upon me.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the       compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell,       and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.       Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not       handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr.       Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in       Hertfordshireâ\\x80\\x94paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to       Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her       friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth       merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.        Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the       readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very       pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight       observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some       time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his       civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the       health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and       after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause, added:        â\\x80\\x9cMy eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you       never happened to see her there?â\\x80\\x9d        She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to       see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed       between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little       confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to       meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the       gentlemen soon afterwards went away.     Chapter 31        Colonel Fitzwilliamâ\\x80\\x99s manners were very much admired at the       Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably       to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some       days, however, before they received any invitation thitherâ\\x80\\x94for       while there were visitors in the house, they could not be       necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after       the gentlemenâ\\x80\\x99s arrival, that they were honoured by such an       attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to       come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very       little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had       called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.       Darcy they had seen only at church.        The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they       joined the party in Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s drawing-room. Her ladyship       received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by       no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she       was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them,       especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the       room.        Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was       a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s pretty       friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated       himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and       Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books       and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained       in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and       flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well       as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned       towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,       after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged,       for she did not scruple to call out:        â\\x80\\x9cWhat is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are       talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it       is.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe are speaking of music, madam,â\\x80\\x9d said he, when no longer able       to avoid a reply.        â\\x80\\x9cOf music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my       delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are       speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose,       who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better       natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great       proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to       apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.       How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s       proficiency.        â\\x80\\x9cI am very glad to hear such a good account of her,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady       Catherine; â\\x80\\x9cand pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to       excel if she does not practice a good deal.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI assure you, madam,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cthat she does not need such       advice. She practises very constantly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cSo much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next       write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any       account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is       to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet       several times, that she will never play really well unless she       practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is       very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every       day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinsonâ\\x80\\x99s room. She       would be in nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s way, you know, in that part of the house.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his auntâ\\x80\\x99s ill-breeding, and       made no answer.        When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of       having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the       instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to       half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew;       till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual       deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to       command a full view of the fair performerâ\\x80\\x99s countenance.       Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient       pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:        â\\x80\\x9cYou mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state       to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play       so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to       be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at       every attempt to intimidate me.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI shall not say you are mistaken,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cbecause you       could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming       you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough       to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing       opinions which in fact are not your own.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said       to Colonel Fitzwilliam, â\\x80\\x9cYour cousin will give you a very pretty       notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am       particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose       my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to       pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it       is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my       disadvantage in Hertfordshireâ\\x80\\x94and, give me leave to say, very       impolitic tooâ\\x80\\x94for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such       things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am not afraid of you,â\\x80\\x9d said he, smilingly.        â\\x80\\x9cPray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colonel       Fitzwilliam. â\\x80\\x9cI should like to know how he behaves among       strangers.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou shall hear thenâ\\x80\\x94but prepare yourself for something very       dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,       you must know, was at a ballâ\\x80\\x94and at this ball, what do you think       he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;       and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was       sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the       fact.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the       assembly beyond my own party.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTrue; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,       Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your       orders.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,â\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cI should have judged better, had I sought       an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to       strangers.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth,       still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. â\\x80\\x9cShall we ask him why a man       of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill       qualified to recommend himself to strangers?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI can answer your question,â\\x80\\x9d said Fitzwilliam, â\\x80\\x9cwithout applying       to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI certainly have not the talent which some people possess,â\\x80\\x9d said       Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cof conversing easily with those I have never seen before.       I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested       in their concerns, as I often see done.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy fingers,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cdo not move over this instrument       in the masterly manner which I see so many womenâ\\x80\\x99s do. They have       not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same       expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own       faultâ\\x80\\x94because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is       not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other       womanâ\\x80\\x99s of superior execution.â\\x80\\x9d        Darcy smiled and said, â\\x80\\x9cYou are perfectly right. You have       employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege       of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us       perform to strangers.â\\x80\\x9d        Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to       know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began       playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening       for a few minutes, said to Darcy:        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,       and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very       good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to       Anneâ\\x80\\x99s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her       health allowed her to learn.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his       cousinâ\\x80\\x99s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other       could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his       behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss       Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_,       had she been his relation.        Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s performance,       mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.       Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility,       and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument       till her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s carriage was ready to take them all home.     Chapter 32        Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to       Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the       village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain       signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it       not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension       was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape       all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very       great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.        He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for       his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the       ladies were to be within.        They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were       made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was       absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in       this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in       Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on       the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:        â\\x80\\x9cHow very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.       Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley       to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he       went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope,       when you left London?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerfectly so, I thank you.â\\x80\\x9d        She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a       short pause added:        â\\x80\\x9cI think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of       ever returning to Netherfield again?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may       spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many       friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements       are continually increasing.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better       for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely,       for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But,       perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the       convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must       expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI should not be surprised,â\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cif he were to give it       up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his       friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to       leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.        He took the hint, and soon began with, â\\x80\\x9cThis seems a very       comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to       it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI believe she didâ\\x80\\x94and I am sure she could not have bestowed her       kindness on a more grateful object.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a       wife.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with       one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him,       or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent       understandingâ\\x80\\x94though I am not certain that I consider her       marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems       perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is       certainly a very good match for her.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a       distance of her own family and friends.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAn easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a       dayâ\\x80\\x99s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI should never have considered the distance as one of the       _advantages_ of the match,â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cI should never have       said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything       beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would       appear far.â\\x80\\x9d        As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she       understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and       Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:        â\\x80\\x9cI do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near       her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on       many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the       expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But       that is not the case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a       comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent       journeysâ\\x80\\x94and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself       _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, â\\x80\\x9c_You_       cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_       cannot have been always at Longbourn.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change       of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the       table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:        â\\x80\\x9cAre you pleased with Kent?â\\x80\\x9d        A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either       side calm and conciseâ\\x80\\x94and soon put an end to by the entrance of       Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The       _tÃªte-Ã\\xa0-tÃªte_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which       had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a       few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.        â\\x80\\x9cWhat can be the meaning of this?â\\x80\\x9d said Charlotte, as soon as he       was gone. â\\x80\\x9cMy dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he       would never have called on us in this familiar way.â\\x80\\x9d        But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very       likely, even to Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s wishes, to be the case; and after       various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to       proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was       the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were       over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a       billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and       in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk       to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a       temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.       They called at various times of the morning, sometimes       separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by       their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam       came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which       of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded       by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his       evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George       Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less       captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliamâ\\x80\\x99s manners, she       believed he might have the best informed mind.        But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more       difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he       frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his       lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity       rather than of choiceâ\\x80\\x94a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to       himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew       not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliamâ\\x80\\x99s occasionally       laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally       different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told       her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the       effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she       set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him       whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford;       but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a       great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It       was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether       there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing       but absence of mind.        She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of       his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the       idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the       subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only       end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a       doubt, that all her friendâ\\x80\\x99s dislike would vanish, if she could       suppose him to be in her power.        In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her       marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most       pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life       was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.       Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin       could have none at all.     Chapter 33        More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,       unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the       mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought,       and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him       at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could       occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and       even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary       penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal       enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually       thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never       said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of       talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of       their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected       questionsâ\\x80\\x94about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of       solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s       happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly       understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she       came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words       seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his       thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an       allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a       little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the       pales opposite the Parsonage.        She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Janeâ\\x80\\x99s last       letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had       not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by       Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was       meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a       smile, she said:        â\\x80\\x9cI did not know before that you ever walked this way.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have been making the tour of the park,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cas I       generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at       the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, I should have turned in a moment.â\\x80\\x9d        And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the       Parsonage together.        â\\x80\\x9cDo you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?â\\x80\\x9d said she.        â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his       disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at       least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know       anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes       than Mr. Darcy.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHe likes to have his own way very well,â\\x80\\x9d replied Colonel       Fitzwilliam. â\\x80\\x9cBut so we all do. It is only that he has better       means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many       others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must       be inured to self-denial and dependence.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIn my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little       of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial       and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money       from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a       fancy for?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThese are home questionsâ\\x80\\x94and perhaps I cannot say that I have       experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of       greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons       cannot marry where they like.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very       often do.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not       many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some       attention to money.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIs this,â\\x80\\x9d thought Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cmeant for me?â\\x80\\x9d and she coloured at       the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, â\\x80\\x9cAnd       pray, what is the usual price of an earlâ\\x80\\x99s younger son? Unless       the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask       above fifty thousand pounds.â\\x80\\x9d        He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To       interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with       what had passed, she soon afterwards said:        â\\x80\\x9cI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the       sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not       marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But,       perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is       under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Colonel Fitzwilliam, â\\x80\\x9cthat is an advantage which he       must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of       Miss Darcy.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAre you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make?       Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age       are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the       true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.â\\x80\\x9d        As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the       manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss       Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she       had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly       replied:        â\\x80\\x9cYou need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I       dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.       She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my       acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard       you say that you know them.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike       manâ\\x80\\x94he is a great friend of Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth drily; â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to       Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCare of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him       in those points where he most wants care. From something that he       told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley       very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I       have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It       was all conjecture.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it you mean?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally       known, because if it were to get round to the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s family, it       would be an unpleasant thing.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be       Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated       himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences       of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any       other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from       believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that       sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of       last summer.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDid Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI understood that there were some very strong objections against       the lady.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd what arts did he use to separate them?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHe did not talk to me of his own arts,â\\x80\\x9d said Fitzwilliam,       smiling. â\\x80\\x9cHe only told me what I have now told you.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with       indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her       why she was so thoughtful.        â\\x80\\x9cI am thinking of what you have been telling me,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cYour       cousinâ\\x80\\x99s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the       judge?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are rather disposed to call his interference officious?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety       of his friendâ\\x80\\x99s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement       alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend       was to be happy. But,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, recollecting herself, â\\x80\\x9cas       we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.       It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the       case.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is not an unnatural surmise,â\\x80\\x9d said Fitzwilliam, â\\x80\\x9cbut it is       a lessening of the honour of my cousinâ\\x80\\x99s triumph very sadly.â\\x80\\x9d        This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a       picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an       answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked       on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There,       shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she       could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It       was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than       those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the       world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless       influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to       separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had       always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and       arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead       him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of       all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had       ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most       affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say       how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.        â\\x80\\x9cThere were some very strong objections against the lady,â\\x80\\x9d were       Colonel Fitzwilliamâ\\x80\\x99s words; and those strong objections probably       were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and       another who was in business in London.        â\\x80\\x9cTo Jane herself,â\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cthere could be no possibility       of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!â\\x80\\x94her       understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners       captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father,       who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy       himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will       probably never reach.â\\x80\\x9d When she thought of her mother, her       confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any       objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose       pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the       want of importance in his friendâ\\x80\\x99s connections, than from their       want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had       been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by       the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.        The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on       a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that,       added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her       not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to       drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did       not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband       from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his       apprehension of Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s being rather displeased by her       staying at home.     Chapter 34        When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate       herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her       employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had       written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual       complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any       communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost       every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which       had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding       from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly       disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.       Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of       uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the       first perusal. Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s shameful boast of what misery he had       been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s       sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to       Rosings was to end on the day after the nextâ\\x80\\x94and, a still       greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with       Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her       spirits, by all that affection could do.        She could not think of Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s leaving Kent without remembering       that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had       made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as       he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.        While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound       of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the       idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once       before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire       particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her       spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter       amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried       manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing       his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered       him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then       getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but       said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came       towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:        â\\x80\\x9cIn vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not       be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire       and love you.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared,       coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient       encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long       felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were       feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was       not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His       sense of her inferiorityâ\\x80\\x94of its being a degradationâ\\x80\\x94of the family       obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on       with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was       wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.        In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be       insensible to the compliment of such a manâ\\x80\\x99s affection, and       though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at       first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to       resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in       anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with       patience, when he should have done. He concluded with       representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in       spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer;       and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her       acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see       that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of       apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real       security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and,       when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:        â\\x80\\x9cIn such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to       express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however       unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation       should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now       thank you. But I cannotâ\\x80\\x94I have never desired your good opinion,       and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry       to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously       done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings       which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of       your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after       this explanation.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes       fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less       resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger,       and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He       was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not       open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The       pause was to Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s feelings dreadful. At length, with a       voice of forced calmness, he said:        â\\x80\\x9cAnd this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of       expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so       little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of       small importance.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI might as well enquire,â\\x80\\x9d replied she, â\\x80\\x9cwhy with so evident a       desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that       you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even       against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility,       if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I       have. Had not my feelings decided against youâ\\x80\\x94had they been       indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that       any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been       the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most       beloved sister?â\\x80\\x9d        As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the       emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to       interrupt her while she continued:        â\\x80\\x9cI have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive       can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You       dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if       not the only means of dividing them from each otherâ\\x80\\x94of exposing       one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and       the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving       them both in misery of the acutest kind.â\\x80\\x9d        She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was       listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any       feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of       affected incredulity.        â\\x80\\x9cCan you deny that you have done it?â\\x80\\x9d she repeated.        With assumed tranquillity he then replied: â\\x80\\x9cI have no wish of       denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend       from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_       I have been kinder than towards myself.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil       reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to       conciliate her.        â\\x80\\x9cBut it is not merely this affair,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, â\\x80\\x9con which my       dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of       you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which       I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject,       what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can       you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you       here impose upon others?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou take an eager interest in that gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s concerns,â\\x80\\x9d said       Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.        â\\x80\\x9cWho that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling       an interest in him?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHis misfortunes!â\\x80\\x9d repeated Darcy contemptuously; â\\x80\\x9cyes, his       misfortunes have been great indeed.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd of your infliction,â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth with energy. â\\x80\\x9cYou have       reduced him to his present state of povertyâ\\x80\\x94comparative poverty.       You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been       designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of       that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You       have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his       misfortune with contempt and ridicule.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd this,â\\x80\\x9d cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the       room, â\\x80\\x9cis your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you       hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,       according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,â\\x80\\x9d       added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, â\\x80\\x9cthese       offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt       by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented       my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might       have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my       struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled       by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection,       by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor       am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and       just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your       connections?â\\x80\\x94to congratulate myself on the hope of relations,       whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she       tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:        â\\x80\\x9cYou are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of       your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared       me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you       behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.â\\x80\\x9d        She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she       continued:        â\\x80\\x9cYou could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible       way that would have tempted me to accept it.â\\x80\\x9d        Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an       expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:        â\\x80\\x9cFrom the very beginningâ\\x80\\x94from the first moment, I may almost       sayâ\\x80\\x94of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with       the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your       selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form       the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have       built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month       before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I       could ever be prevailed on to marry.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your       feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have       been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and       accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.â\\x80\\x9d        And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth       heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.        The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how       to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried       for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had       passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should       receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have       been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to       wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made       him prevent his friendâ\\x80\\x99s marrying her sister, and which must       appear at least with equal force in his own caseâ\\x80\\x94was almost       incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so       strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable prideâ\\x80\\x94his       shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Janeâ\\x80\\x94his       unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not       justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned       Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to       deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his       attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very       agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s carriage       made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s       observation, and hurried her away to her room.     Chapter 35        Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and       meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not       yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was       impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for       employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge       herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her       favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s sometimes       coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she       turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The       park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon       passed one of the gates into the ground.        After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she       was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the       gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now       passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and       every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was       on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of       a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was       moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was       directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near       enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,       pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself       called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she       moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it       also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took,       said, with a look of haughty composure, â\\x80\\x9cI have been walking in       the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me       the honour of reading that letter?â\\x80\\x9d And then, with a slight bow,       turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.        With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest       curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still       increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of       letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The       envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the       lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight       oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, and was as follows:â\\x80\\x94        â\\x80\\x9cBe not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the       apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments       or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to       you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling       myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,       cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation       and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been       spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.       You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your       attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but       I demand it of your justice.        â\\x80\\x9cTwo offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of       equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first       mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I       had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I       had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and       humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the       prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown       off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my       father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on       our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its       exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two       young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few       weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that       blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each       circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the       following account of my actions and their motives has been read.       If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am       under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive       to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be       obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.        â\\x80\\x9cI had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common       with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any       other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening       of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his       feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love       before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you,       I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucasâ\\x80\\x99s accidental       information, that Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s attentions to your sister had given       rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it       as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.       From that moment I observed my friendâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour attentively;       and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was       beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also       watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging       as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I       remained convinced from the eveningâ\\x80\\x99s scrutiny, that though she       received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by       any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken       here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of       your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have       been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment       has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,       that the serenity of your sisterâ\\x80\\x99s countenance and air was such       as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,       however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily       touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is       certainâ\\x80\\x94but I will venture to say that my investigation and       decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did       not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed       it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My       objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last       night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion       to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be       so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other       causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and       existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself       endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before       me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of       your motherâ\\x80\\x99s family, though objectionable, was nothing in       comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so       almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger       sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It       pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects       of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this       representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider       that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of       the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and       your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and       disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what       passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and       every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to       preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy       connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,       as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon       returning.        â\\x80\\x9cThe part which I acted is now to be explained. His sistersâ\\x80\\x99       uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence       of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time       was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on       joining him directly in London. We accordingly wentâ\\x80\\x94and there I       readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the       certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them       earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or       delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would       ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded       by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sisterâ\\x80\\x99s       indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection       with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great       natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than       on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived       himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against       returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been       given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself       for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in       the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it       is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to       conceal from him your sisterâ\\x80\\x99s being in town. I knew it myself,       as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet       ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence       is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough       extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this       concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,       and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more       to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your       sisterâ\\x80\\x99s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives       which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient,       I have not yet learnt to condemn them.        â\\x80\\x9cWith respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having       injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you       the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has       _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what       I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted       veracity.        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for       many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose       good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my       father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was       his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My       father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridgeâ\\x80\\x94most       important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the       extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a       gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s education. My father was not only fond of this young       manâ\\x80\\x99s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also       the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his       profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it       is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very       different manner. The vicious propensitiesâ\\x80\\x94the want of principle,       which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best       friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly       the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing       him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here       again I shall give you painâ\\x80\\x94to what degree you only can tell. But       whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a       suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his       real characterâ\\x80\\x94it adds even another motive.        â\\x80\\x9cMy excellent father died about five years ago; and his       attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his       will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his       advancement in the best manner that his profession might       allowâ\\x80\\x94and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family       living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a       legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long       survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.       Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against       taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for       him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of       the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some       intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that       the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient       support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be       sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his       proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;       the business was therefore soon settledâ\\x80\\x94he resigned all claim to       assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be       in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three       thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved.       I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his       society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his       studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all       restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For       about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of       the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he       applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His       circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in       believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most       unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being       ordained, if I would present him to the living in questionâ\\x80\\x94of       which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well       assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could       not have forgotten my revered fatherâ\\x80\\x99s intentions. You will       hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for       resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in       proportion to the distress of his circumstancesâ\\x80\\x94and he was       doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his       reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of       acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last       summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.        â\\x80\\x9cI must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget       myself, and which no obligation less than the present should       induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I       feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten       years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my motherâ\\x80\\x99s       nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she       was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in       London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over       it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly       by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance       between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most       unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far       recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart       retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child,       that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent       to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her       excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that       I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly       a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana,       unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother       whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole       to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my       sisterâ\\x80\\x99s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I       wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.       Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s chief       object was unquestionably my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s fortune, which is thirty       thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of       revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge       would have been complete indeed.        â\\x80\\x9cThis, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we       have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject       it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty       towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form       of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not       perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of       everything concerning either, detection could not be in your       power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.        â\\x80\\x9cYou may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last       night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what       could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here       related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of       Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant       intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s       will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of       these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_       assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause       from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the       possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some       opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of       the morning. I will only add, God bless you.        â\\x80\\x9cFITZWILLIAM DARCYâ\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 36        If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect       it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no       expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may       well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a       contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read       were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first       understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and       steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation       to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a       strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his       account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an       eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from       impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was       incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.       His belief of her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s insensibility she instantly resolved       to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to       the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him       justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which       satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was       all pride and insolence.        But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.       Wickhamâ\\x80\\x94when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation       of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion       of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own       history of himselfâ\\x80\\x94her feelings were yet more acutely painful and       more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and       even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely,       repeatedly exclaiming, â\\x80\\x9cThis must be false! This cannot be! This       must be the grossest falsehood!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and when she had gone through       the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last       page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not       regard it, that she would never look in it again.        In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on       nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the       letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she       could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related       to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the       meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the       Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the       kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known       its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each       recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the       difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was       fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was       impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side       or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that       her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the       closest attention, the particulars immediately following of       Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his       receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds,       again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter,       weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be       impartialityâ\\x80\\x94deliberated on the probability of each statementâ\\x80\\x94but       with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again       she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,       which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could       so represent as to render Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s conduct in it less than       infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely       blameless throughout the whole.        The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to       lay at Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more       so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never       heard of him before his entrance into the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire Militia, in       which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on       meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight       acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in       Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character,       had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of       enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him       at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect       some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity       or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.       Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for       those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what       Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many yearsâ\\x80\\x99       continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could       see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address;       but she could remember no more substantial good than the general       approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social       powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a       considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas!       the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received       some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel       Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she       was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel       Fitzwilliam himselfâ\\x80\\x94from whom she had previously received the       information of his near concern in all his cousinâ\\x80\\x99s affairs, and       whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she       had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked       by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly       banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have       hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his       cousinâ\\x80\\x99s corroboration.        She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in       conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening       at Mr. Phillipsâ\\x80\\x99s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in       her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such       communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her       before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he       had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his       conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of       seeing Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x94that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that       _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield       ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the       Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story       to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been       everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples       in sinking Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s character, though he had assured her that       respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.        How differently did everything now appear in which he was       concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence       of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of       her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but       his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself       could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been       deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his       vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had       most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour       grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.       Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned       by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;       that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in       the whole course of their acquaintanceâ\\x80\\x94an acquaintance which had       latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of       intimacy with his waysâ\\x80\\x94seen anything that betrayed him to be       unprincipled or unjustâ\\x80\\x94anything that spoke him of irreligious or       immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed       and valuedâ\\x80\\x94that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother,       and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his       sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had       his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a       violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed       from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of       it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.        She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor       Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,       partial, prejudiced, absurd.        â\\x80\\x9cHow despicably I have acted!â\\x80\\x9d she cried; â\\x80\\x9cI, who have prided       myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my       abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my       sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!       How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation!       Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!       But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the       preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on       the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted       prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either       were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.â\\x80\\x9d        From herself to Janeâ\\x80\\x94from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a       line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s       explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read       it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.       How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,       which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared       himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s attachment;       and she could not help remembering what Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s opinion had       always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his       description of Jane. She felt that Janeâ\\x80\\x99s feelings, though       fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant       complacency in her air and manner not often united with great       sensibility.        When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were       mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her       sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her       too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he       particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball,       and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have       made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.        The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It       soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had       thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she       considered that Janeâ\\x80\\x99s disappointment had in fact been the work       of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit       of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt       depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.        After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every       variety of thoughtâ\\x80\\x94re-considering events, determining       probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to       a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection       of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she       entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,       and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make       her unfit for conversation.        She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had       each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few       minutes, to take leaveâ\\x80\\x94but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been       sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and       almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.       Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she       really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an       object; she could think only of her letter.     Chapter 37        The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins       having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting       obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of       their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits       as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone       through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady       Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with       great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that       she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having       them all to dine with her.        Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,       had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to       her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of       what her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s indignation would have been. â\\x80\\x9cWhat would she       have said? how would she have behaved?â\\x80\\x9d were questions with which       she amused herself.        Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. â\\x80\\x9cI       assure you, I feel it exceedingly,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Catherine; â\\x80\\x9cI       believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I       am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be       so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so       they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably       till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,       more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings       certainly increases.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,       which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.        Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed       out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by       supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she       added:        â\\x80\\x9cBut if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg       that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad       of your company, I am sure.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,â\\x80\\x9d       replied Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cbut it is not in my power to accept it. I       must be in town next Saturday.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhy, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I       expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before       you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs.       Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.       Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if       you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to       take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in       June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the       barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of youâ\\x80\\x94and       indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not       object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our       original plan.â\\x80\\x9d        Lady Catherine seemed resigned. â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Collins, you must send a       servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot       bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.       It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have       the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young       women should always be properly guarded and attended, according       to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to       Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two       men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy,       of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with       propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to       all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.       Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would       really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy uncle is to send a servant for us.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad       you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you       change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at       the Bell, you will be attended to.â\\x80\\x9d        Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their       journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention       was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or,       with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.       Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was       alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day       went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in       all the delight of unpleasant recollections.        Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by       heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its       writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the       style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when       she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,       her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed       feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited       gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not       approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or       feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own       past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and       regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of       yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father,       contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to       restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her       mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely       insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane       in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;       but while they were supported by their motherâ\\x80\\x99s indulgence, what       chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,       irritable, and completely under Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s guidance, had been always       affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,       would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and       vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt       with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they       would be going there forever.        Anxiety on Janeâ\\x80\\x99s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.       Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good       opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His       affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct       cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness       of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the       thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so       replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been       deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!        When to these recollections was added the development of       Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s character, it may be easily believed that the happy       spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much       affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear       tolerably cheerful.        Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last       week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening       was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into       the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the       best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of       placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself       obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and       pack her trunk afresh.        When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,       wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford       again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to       curtsey and hold out her hand to both.     Chapter 38        On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a       few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the       opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed       indispensably necessary.        â\\x80\\x9cI know not, Miss Elizabeth,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cwhether Mrs. Collins has       yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I       am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving       her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt,       I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our       humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few       domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford       extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will       believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done       everything in our power to prevent your spending your time       unpleasantly.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.       She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of       being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received,       must make _her_ feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and       with a more smiling solemnity replied:        â\\x80\\x9cIt gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your       time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most       fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very       superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the       frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may       flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been       entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s       family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing       which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see       how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge       that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I       should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion,       while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.â\\x80\\x9d        Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he       was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to       unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.        â\\x80\\x9cYou may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into       Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you       will be able to do so. Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s great attentions to Mrs.       Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust       it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunateâ\\x80\\x94but       on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure       you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most       cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte       and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in       everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas       between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where       that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she       firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was       not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by       the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy       to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes       open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to       go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her       housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent       concerns, had not yet lost their charms.        At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the       parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After       an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was       attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down       the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all       her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had       received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr.       and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria       followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he       suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had       hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at       Rosings.        â\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d he added, â\\x80\\x9cyou will of course wish to have your humble       respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their       kindness to you while you have been here.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be       shut, and the carriage drove off.        â\\x80\\x9cGood gracious!â\\x80\\x9d cried Maria, after a few minutesâ\\x80\\x99 silence, â\\x80\\x9cit       seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many       things have happened!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cA great many indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said her companion with a sigh.        â\\x80\\x9cWe have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there       twice! How much I shall have to tell!â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth added privately, â\\x80\\x9cAnd how much I shall have to       conceal!â\\x80\\x9d        Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any       alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they       reached Mr. Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s house, where they were to remain a few       days.        Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of       studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the       kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go       home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for       observation.        It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even       for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s       proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would       so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so       highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been       able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing       could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she       remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her       fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into       repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister       further.     Chapter 39        It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies       set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94, in       Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.       Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in       token of the coachmanâ\\x80\\x99s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking       out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an       hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite       milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad       and cucumber.        After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a       table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually       affords, exclaiming, â\\x80\\x9cIs not this nice? Is not this an agreeable       surprise?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd we mean to treat you all,â\\x80\\x9d added Lydia, â\\x80\\x9cbut you must lend       us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.â\\x80\\x9d       Then, showing her purchasesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cLook here, I have bought this       bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might       as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get       home, and see if I can make it up any better.â\\x80\\x9d        And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect       unconcern, â\\x80\\x9cOh! but there were two or three much uglier in the       shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim       it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it       will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the       â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAre they indeed!â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, with the greatest       satisfaction.        â\\x80\\x9cThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want       papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a       delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at       all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a       miserable summer else we shall have!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d thought Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9c_that_ would be a delightful scheme       indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton,       and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset       already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of       Meryton!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNow I have got some news for you,â\\x80\\x9d said Lydia, as they sat down       at table. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think? It is excellent newsâ\\x80\\x94capital       newsâ\\x80\\x94and about a certain person we all like!â\\x80\\x9d        Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told       he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:        â\\x80\\x9cAye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You       thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he       often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is       an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long       chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear       Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger       of Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s marrying Mary King. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s for you! She is gone       down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd Mary King is safe!â\\x80\\x9d added Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9csafe from a connection       imprudent as to fortune.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,â\\x80\\x9d said       Jane.        â\\x80\\x9cI am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never       cared three straws about herâ\\x80\\x94who _could_ about such a nasty       little freckled thing?â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such       coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the       _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had harboured       and fancied liberal!        As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was       ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all       their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition       of Kittyâ\\x80\\x99s and Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s purchases, were seated in it.        â\\x80\\x9cHow nicely we are all crammed in,â\\x80\\x9d cried Lydia. â\\x80\\x9cI am glad I       bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another       bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk       and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear       what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen       any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes       that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.       Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost       three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being       married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to       get husbands, you canâ\\x80\\x99t think. She says Lizzy had better have       taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any       fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of       you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear       me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel       Forsterâ\\x80\\x99s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.       Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the       bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked       the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was       forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We       dressed up Chamberlayne in womanâ\\x80\\x99s clothes on purpose to pass for       a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel       and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were       forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how       well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or       three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the       least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I       should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and       then they soon found out what was the matter.â\\x80\\x9d        With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did       Lydia, assisted by Kittyâ\\x80\\x99s hints and additions, endeavour to       amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened       as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent       mention of Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s name.        Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to       see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner       did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:        â\\x80\\x9cI am glad you are come back, Lizzy.â\\x80\\x9d        Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the       Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were       the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was enquiring of       Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.       Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of       the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and,       on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and       Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other personâ\\x80\\x99s, was       enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who       would hear her.        â\\x80\\x9cOh! Mary,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cI wish you had gone with us, for we had       such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and       pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone       so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to       the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated       the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and       if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then       when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have       got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we       were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,       that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!â\\x80\\x9d        To this Mary very gravely replied, â\\x80\\x9cFar be it from me, my dear       sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be       congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they       would have no charms for _me_â\\x80\\x94I should infinitely prefer a book.â\\x80\\x9d        But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to       anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary       at all.        In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to       walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth       steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss       Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in       pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her       opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was       resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_ of       the regimentâ\\x80\\x99s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.       In a fortnight they were to goâ\\x80\\x94and once gone, she hoped there       could be nothing more to plague her on his account.        She had not been many hours at home before she found that the       Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn,       was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw       directly that her father had not the smallest intention of       yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and       equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never       yet despaired of succeeding at last.     Chapter 40        Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened       could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress       every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing       her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the       chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.        Miss Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong       sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear       perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other       feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his       sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but       still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s       refusal must have given him.        â\\x80\\x9cHis being so sure of succeeding was wrong,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cand       certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it       must increase his disappointment!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cI am heartily sorry for him; but he       has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his       regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBlame you! Oh, no.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very       next day.â\\x80\\x9d        She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents       as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this       for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world       without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole       race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was       Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of       consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour       to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one       without involving the other.        â\\x80\\x9cThis will not do,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cyou never will be able to       make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you       must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of       merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and       of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am       inclined to believe it all Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s; but you shall do as you       choose.â\\x80\\x9d        It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from       Jane.        â\\x80\\x9cI do not know when I have been more shocked,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cWickham       so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear       Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a       disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!       and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too       distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you       so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that       I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your       profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much       longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPoor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his       countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThere certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of       those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other       all the appearance of it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it       as you used to do.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a       dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to oneâ\\x80\\x99s       genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.       One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but       one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then       stumbling on something witty.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not       treat the matter as you do now.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say       unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane       to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain       and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow unfortunate that you should have used such very strong       expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they       _do_ appear wholly undeserved.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCertainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a       most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been       encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I       want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our       acquaintances in general understand Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s character.â\\x80\\x9d        Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, â\\x80\\x9cSurely there can       be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your       opinion?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised       me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every       particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as       possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to       the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general       prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the       death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him       in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be       gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he       really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we       may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present       I will say nothing about it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin       him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and       anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him       desperate.â\\x80\\x9d        The tumult of Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s mind was allayed by this conversation.       She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her       for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,       whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was       still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the       disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s       letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been       valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could       partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect       understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing       off this last encumbrance of mystery. â\\x80\\x9cAnd then,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cif       that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely       be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable       manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till       it has lost all its value!â\\x80\\x9d        She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the       real state of her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still       cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even       fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of       first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater       steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so       fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every       other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the       feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence       of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health       and their tranquillity.        â\\x80\\x9cWell, Lizzy,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet one day, â\\x80\\x9cwhat is your opinion       _now_ of this sad business of Janeâ\\x80\\x99s? For my part, I am       determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my       sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane       saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving       young manâ\\x80\\x94and I do not suppose thereâ\\x80\\x99s the least chance in the       world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming       to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of       everybody, too, who is likely to know.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come.       Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and       if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort       is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will       be sorry for what he has done.â\\x80\\x9d        But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such       expectation, she made no answer.        â\\x80\\x9cWell, Lizzy,â\\x80\\x9d continued her mother, soon afterwards, â\\x80\\x9cand so the       Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope       it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is       an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her       mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in       _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, nothing at all.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cA great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes.       _They_ will take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will       never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!       And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your       father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say,       whenever that happens.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt was a subject which they could not mention before me.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt       they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be       easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the       better. _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only       entailed on me.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 41        The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.       It was the last of the regimentâ\\x80\\x99s stay in Meryton, and all the       young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The       dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were       still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course       of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for       this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was       extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in       any of the family.        â\\x80\\x9cGood Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?â\\x80\\x9d would       they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. â\\x80\\x9cHow can you be       smiling so, Lizzy?â\\x80\\x9d        Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered       what she had herself endured on a similar occasion,       five-and-twenty years ago.        â\\x80\\x9cI am sure,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cI cried for two days together when       Colonel Millerâ\\x80\\x99s regiment went away. I thought I should have       broken my heart.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am sure I shall break _mine_,â\\x80\\x9d said Lydia.        â\\x80\\x9cIf one could but go to Brighton!â\\x80\\x9d observed Mrs. Bennet.        â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes!â\\x80\\x94if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so       disagreeable.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cA little sea-bathing would set me up forever.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of       good,â\\x80\\x9d added Kitty.        Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through       Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all       sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of       Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s objections; and never had she been so much disposed       to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.        But the gloom of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s prospect was shortly cleared away; for       she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the       colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This       invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately       married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had       recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_       monthsâ\\x80\\x99 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.        The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.       Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of       Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her       sisterâ\\x80\\x99s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless       ecstasy, calling for everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s congratulations, and laughing and       talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty       continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as       unreasonable as her accent was peevish.        â\\x80\\x9cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as       Lydia,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I       have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for       I am two years older.â\\x80\\x9d        In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to       make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was       so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother       and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all       possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as       such a step must make her were it known, she could not help       secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented       to him all the improprieties of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s general behaviour, the       little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a       woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more       imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the       temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her       attentively, and then said:        â\\x80\\x9cLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some       public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with       so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the       present circumstances.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf you were aware,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cof the very great       disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of       Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s unguarded and imprudent mannerâ\\x80\\x94nay, which has already       arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the       affair.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAlready arisen?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Bennet. â\\x80\\x9cWhat, has she frightened       away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast       down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a       little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the       list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s       folly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It       is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now       complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must       be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of       all restraint which mark Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s character. Excuse me, for I must       speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble       of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her       present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will       soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be       fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt       that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in       the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any       attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the       ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off       any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for       admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is       comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,       ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father,       can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and       despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not       be often involved in the disgrace?â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and       affectionately taking her hand said in reply:        â\\x80\\x9cDo not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are       known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear       to less advantage for having a couple ofâ\\x80\\x94or I may say, threeâ\\x80\\x94very       silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does       not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a       sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she       is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At       Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt       than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth       their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may       teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow       many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the       rest of her life.â\\x80\\x9d        With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own       opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and       sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her       vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having       performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or       augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.        Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference       with her father, their indignation would hardly have found       expression in their united volubility. In Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s imagination, a       visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly       happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets       of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself       the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present       unknown. She saw all the glories of the campâ\\x80\\x94its tents stretched       forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young       and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the       view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting       with at least six officers at once.        Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects       and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?       They could have been understood only by her mother, who might       have felt nearly the same. Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s going to Brighton was all that       consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s never       intending to go there himself.        But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their       raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of       Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s leaving home.        Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having       been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation       was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality       entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very       gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a       sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to       herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the       inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which       had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,       after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern       for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such       idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed       it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing,       that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had       been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference       secured at any time by their renewal.        On the very last day of the regimentâ\\x80\\x99s remaining at Meryton, he       dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little       was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on       his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had       passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliamâ\\x80\\x99s and Mr.       Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him,       if he was acquainted with the former.        He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a momentâ\\x80\\x99s       recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly       seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very       gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer       was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon       afterwards added:        â\\x80\\x9cHow long did you say he was at Rosings?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNearly three weeks.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd you saw him frequently?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, almost every day.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHis manners are very different from his cousinâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon       acquaintance.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.       â\\x80\\x9cAnd pray, may I ask?â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d But checking himself, he added, in a       gayer tone, â\\x80\\x9cIs it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to       add aught of civility to his ordinary style?â\\x80\\x94for I dare not       hope,â\\x80\\x9d he continued in a lower and more serious tone, â\\x80\\x9cthat he is       improved in essentials.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, no!â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cIn essentials, I believe, he is very       much what he ever was.â\\x80\\x9d        While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to       rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a       something in her countenance which made him listen with an       apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:        â\\x80\\x9cWhen I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean       that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but       that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better       understood.â\\x80\\x9d        Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and       agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off       his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the       gentlest of accents:        â\\x80\\x9cYou, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily       comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to       assume even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that       direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others,       for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have       suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which       you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his       visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands       much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when       they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish       of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain       he has very much at heart.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered       only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted       to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was       in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with       the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no       further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last       with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never       meeting again.        When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to       Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.       The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than       pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep       from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good       wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her       injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying       herself as much as possibleâ\\x80\\x94advice which there was every reason       to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous       happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle       adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.     Chapter 42        Had Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she       could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal       felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and       beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty       generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and       illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all       real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had       vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were       overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek       comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had       brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the       unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the       country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his       principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise       indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his       amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in       general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of       entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive       benefit from such as are given.        Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of       her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with       pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his       affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what       she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that       continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in       exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so       highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now       the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable       a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising       from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which,       rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of       his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his       wife.        When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s departure she found       little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.       Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home       she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the       dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their       domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her       natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were       removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil       might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly       and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a       watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found,       what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she       had looked forward with impatient desire did not, in taking       place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It       was consequently necessary to name some other period for the       commencement of actual felicityâ\\x80\\x94to have some other point on which       her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the       pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and       prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now       the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation       for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her       mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included       Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.        â\\x80\\x9cBut it is fortunate,â\\x80\\x9d thought she, â\\x80\\x9cthat I have something to       wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment       would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless       source of regret in my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s absence, I may reasonably hope to       have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which       every part promises delight can never be successful; and general       disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little       peculiar vexation.â\\x80\\x9d        When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very       minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always       long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother       contained little else than that they were just returned from the       library, where such and such officers had attended them, and       where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite       wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would       have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a       violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going       off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister,       there was still less to be learntâ\\x80\\x94for her letters to Kitty,       though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words       to be made public.        After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,       good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.       Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in       town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer       engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual       querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much       recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event       of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the       following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not       to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and       malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should       be quartered in Meryton.        The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now       fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a       letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its       commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be       prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in       July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that       left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as       they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and       comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the       Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to       the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than       Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy       the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a       peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly       passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a       few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all       the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the       Peak.        Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on       seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time       enough. But it was her business to be satisfiedâ\\x80\\x94and certainly her       temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.        With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.       It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of       Pemberley and its owner. â\\x80\\x9cBut surely,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cI may enter his       county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without       his perceiving me.â\\x80\\x9d        The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to       pass away before her uncle and auntâ\\x80\\x99s arrival. But they did pass       away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at       length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and       eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the       particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general       favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly       adapted her for attending to them in every wayâ\\x80\\x94teaching them,       playing with them, and loving them.        The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the       next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.       One enjoyment was certainâ\\x80\\x94that of suitableness of companions; a       suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear       inconveniencesâ\\x80\\x94cheerfulness to enhance every pleasureâ\\x80\\x94and       affection and intelligence, which might supply it among       themselves if there were disappointments abroad.        It is not the object of this work to give a description of       Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which       their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,       Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of       Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of       Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s former residence, and where       she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they       bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of       the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found       from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their       direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking       over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an       inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his       willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.        â\\x80\\x9cMy love, should not you like to see a place of which you have       heard so much?â\\x80\\x9d said her aunt; â\\x80\\x9ca place, too, with which so many       of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth       there, you know.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at       Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing       it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after       going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or       satin curtains.        Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. â\\x80\\x9cIf it were merely a fine       house richly furnished,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cI should not care about it       myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the       finest woods in the country.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth said no moreâ\\x80\\x94but her mind could not acquiesce. The       possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,       instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very       idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt       than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;       and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if       her private enquiries to the absence of the family were       unfavourably answered.        Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid       whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name       of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family       were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the       last questionâ\\x80\\x94and her alarms now being removed, she was at       leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house       herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and       she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper       air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the       scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.     Chapter 43        Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance       of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length       they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.        The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.       They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some       time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.        Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and       admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually       ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of       a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was       instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite       side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.       It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising       ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,       a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but       without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal       nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen       a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty       had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were       all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt       that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!        They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the       door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all       her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest       the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,       they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited       for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she       was.        The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much       less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding       her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,       well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after       slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.       The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving       increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.       Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the       whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the       winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with       delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were       taking different positions; but from every window there were       beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their       furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but       Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither       gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real       elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd of this place,â\\x80\\x9d thought she, â\\x80\\x9cI might have been mistress!       With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!       Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in       them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and       aunt. But no,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94recollecting herselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthat could never be; my       uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been       allowed to invite them.â\\x80\\x9d        This was a lucky recollectionâ\\x80\\x94it saved her from something very       like regret.        She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was       really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,       the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with       alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, â\\x80\\x9cBut we       expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.â\\x80\\x9d How       rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any       circumstance been delayed a day!        Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and       saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other       miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly,       how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it       was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late masterâ\\x80\\x99s       steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. â\\x80\\x9cHe       is now gone into the army,â\\x80\\x9d she added; â\\x80\\x9cbut I am afraid he has       turned out very wild.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth       could not return it.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd that,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the       miniatures, â\\x80\\x9cis my masterâ\\x80\\x94and very like him. It was drawn at the       same time as the otherâ\\x80\\x94about eight years ago.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have heard much of your masterâ\\x80\\x99s fine person,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.       Gardiner, looking at the picture; â\\x80\\x9cit is a handsome face. But,       Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this       intimation of her knowing her master.        â\\x80\\x9cDoes that young lady know Mr. Darcy?â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth coloured, and said: â\\x80\\x9cA little.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, maâ\\x80\\x99am?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, very handsome.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up       stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.       This room was my late masterâ\\x80\\x99s favourite room, and these       miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of       them.â\\x80\\x9d        This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s being among them.        Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,       drawn when she was only eight years old.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.       Gardiner.        â\\x80\\x9cOh! yesâ\\x80\\x94the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so       accomplished!â\\x80\\x94She plays and sings all day long. In the next room       is a new instrument just come down for herâ\\x80\\x94a present from my       master; she comes here to-morrow with him.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,       encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks;       Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great       pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.        â\\x80\\x9cIs your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNot so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend       half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer       months.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cExcept,â\\x80\\x9d thought Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cwhen she goes to Ramsgate.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf your master would marry, you might see more of him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know       who is good enough for him.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,       â\\x80\\x9cIt is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think       so.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows       him,â\\x80\\x9d replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty       far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the       housekeeper added, â\\x80\\x9cI have never known a cross word from him in       my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.â\\x80\\x9d        This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite       to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her       firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed       to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:        â\\x80\\x9cThere are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are       lucky in having such a master.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I       could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that       they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when       they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most       generous-hearted boy in the world.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth almost stared at her. â\\x80\\x9cCan this be Mr. Darcy?â\\x80\\x9d thought       she.        â\\x80\\x9cHis father was an excellent man,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Gardiner.        â\\x80\\x9cYes, maâ\\x80\\x99am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like       himâ\\x80\\x94just as affable to the poor.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for       more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She       related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the       rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner,       highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he       attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led       again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many       merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.        â\\x80\\x9cHe is the best landlord, and the best master,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cthat       ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of       nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or       servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him       proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it       is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIn what an amiable light does this place him!â\\x80\\x9d thought       Elizabeth.        â\\x80\\x9cThis fine account of him,â\\x80\\x9d whispered her aunt as they walked,       â\\x80\\x9cis not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps we might be deceived.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is not very likely; our authority was too good.â\\x80\\x9d        On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very       pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and       lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it       was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a       liking to the room when last at Pemberley.        â\\x80\\x9cHe is certainly a good brother,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, as she walked       towards one of the windows.        Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s delight, when she should       enter the room. â\\x80\\x9cAnd this is always the way with him,â\\x80\\x9d she added.       â\\x80\\x9cWhatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in       a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.â\\x80\\x9d        The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,       were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good       paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such       as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to       look at some drawings of Miss Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s, in crayons, whose subjects       were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.        In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could       have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked       in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.       At last it arrested herâ\\x80\\x94and she beheld a striking resemblance to       Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to       have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several       minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and       returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs.       Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s       lifetime.        There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s mind, a more       gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at       the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on       him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is       more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a       brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many peopleâ\\x80\\x99s       happiness were in his guardianship!â\\x80\\x94how much of pleasure or pain       was it in his power to bestow!â\\x80\\x94how much of good or evil must be       done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the       housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood       before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes       upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment       of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its       warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.        When all of the house that was open to general inspection had       been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the       housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at       the hall-door.        As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth       turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and       while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,       the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,       which led behind it to the stables.        They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was       his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their       eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with       the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed       immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced       towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of       perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.        She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,       received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be       overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the       picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure       the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardenerâ\\x80\\x99s       expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately       have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to       their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift       her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to       his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of       his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered       was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the       impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the       few minutes in which they continued were some of the most       uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;       when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and       he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left       Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so       hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.        At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a       few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected       himself, and took leave.        The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his       figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by       her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered       by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,       the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must       appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so       vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself       in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come       a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes       sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his       discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment       arrivedâ\\x80\\x94that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She       blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And       his behaviour, so strikingly alteredâ\\x80\\x94what could it mean? That he       should even speak to her was amazing!â\\x80\\x94but to speak with such       civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she       seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with       such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast       did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his       letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to       account for it.        They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,       and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a       finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it       was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,       though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her       uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as       they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her       thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,       whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to       know what at the moment was passing in his mindâ\\x80\\x94in what manner he       thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was       still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt       himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was       not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in       seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her       with composure.        At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence       of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more       like herself.        They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a       while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where       the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many       charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long       range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the       stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole       park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant       smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the       matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought       them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to       the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They       crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air       of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet       visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed       room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough       coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its       windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived       their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great       walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the       carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,       obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on       the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but       their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to       indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much       engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in       the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced       but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were       again surprised, and Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s astonishment was quite equal to       what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching       them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less       sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before       they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more       prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and       to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a       few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into       some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk       concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was       immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost       none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she       began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she       had not got beyond the words â\\x80\\x9cdelightful,â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9ccharming,â\\x80\\x9d when       some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise       of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her       colour changed, and she said no more.        Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,       he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to       her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was       quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his       being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people       against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.       â\\x80\\x9cWhat will be his surprise,â\\x80\\x9d thought she, â\\x80\\x9cwhen he knows who they       are? He takes them now for people of fashion.â\\x80\\x9d        The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named       their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to       see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his       decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.       That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he       sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going       away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with       Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but       triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some       relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most       attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every       expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his       intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.        The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.       Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as       often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,       offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and       pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually       most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with       Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said       nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be       all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and       continually was she repeating, â\\x80\\x9cWhy is he so altered? From what       can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_â\\x80\\x94it cannot be for _my_ sake       that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could       not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should       still love me.â\\x80\\x9d        After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the       two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending       to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some       curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It       originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the       morning, found Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s arm inadequate to her support, and       consequently preferred her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s. Mr. Darcy took her place by       her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,       the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been       assured of his absence before she came to the place, and       accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very       unexpectedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cfor your housekeeper,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cinformed us that       you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,       before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not       immediately expected in the country.â\\x80\\x9d He acknowledged the truth       of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned       his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with       whom he had been travelling. â\\x80\\x9cThey will join me early to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d       he continued, â\\x80\\x9cand among them are some who will claim an       acquaintance with youâ\\x80\\x94Mr. Bingley and his sisters.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were       instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s name had       been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by       his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.        â\\x80\\x9cThere is also one other person in the party,â\\x80\\x9d he continued after       a pause, â\\x80\\x9cwho more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will       you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to       your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?â\\x80\\x9d        The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too       great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She       immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of       being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,       without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying       to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of       her.        They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.       Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was       flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her       was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the       others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.       Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.        He then asked her to walk into the houseâ\\x80\\x94but she declared herself       not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time       much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She       wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every       subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,       and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.       Yet time and her aunt moved slowlyâ\\x80\\x94and her patience and her ideas       were nearly worn out before the _tÃªte-Ã\\xa0-tÃªte_ was over.        On Mr. and Mrs. Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s coming up they were all pressed to go       into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,       and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy       handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,       Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.        The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of       them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they       had expected. â\\x80\\x9cHe is perfectly well behaved, polite, and       unassuming,â\\x80\\x9d said her uncle.        â\\x80\\x9cThere _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,â\\x80\\x9d       replied her aunt, â\\x80\\x9cbut it is confined to his air, and is not       unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some       people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was       more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no       necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was       very trifling.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, Lizzy,â\\x80\\x9d said her aunt, â\\x80\\x9che is not so handsome as       Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s countenance, for his       features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he       was so disagreeable?â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had       liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that       she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.        â\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,â\\x80\\x9d       replied her uncle. â\\x80\\x9cYour great men often are; and therefore I       shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind       another day, and warn me off his grounds.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his       character, but said nothing.        â\\x80\\x9cFrom what we have seen of him,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Gardiner, â\\x80\\x9cI       really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so       cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not       an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing       about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity       in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea       of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his       house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help       laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,       and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in       vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them       to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what       she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were       capable of a very different construction; and that his character       was by no means so faulty, nor Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s so amiable, as they had       been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she       related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in       which they had been connected, without actually naming her       authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.        Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now       approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave       way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in       pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its       environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by       the morningâ\\x80\\x99s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off       again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was       spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many       yearsâ\\x80\\x99 discontinuance.        The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave       Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she       could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s       civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted       with his sister.     Chapter 44        Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to       visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was       consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole       of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very       morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They       had been walking about the place with some of their new friends,       and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining       with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a       window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving       up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery,       guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her       surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour       which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and       the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the       circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the       preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing       had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no       other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter       than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these       newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation       of Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was       quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of       disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should       have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious       to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing       would fail her.        She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she       walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw       such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made       everything worse.        Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable       introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that       her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.       Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was       exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes       convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it       difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.        Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,       though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her       appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her       brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her       manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had       expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as       ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such       different feelings.        They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that       Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time       to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when       Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he       entered the room. All Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s anger against him had been long       done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood       its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he       expressed himself on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly,       though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with       the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.        To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting       personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The       whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The       suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece       directed their observation towards each with an earnest though       guarded enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full       conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of       the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that       the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.        Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain       the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her       own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter       object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of       success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were       prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was       eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.        In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;       and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his       were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he       talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased       herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying       to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she       could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had       been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side       that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that       could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon       satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere       they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a       recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of       saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.       He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking       together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that       it â\\x80\\x9cwas a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing       her;â\\x80\\x9d and, before she could reply, he added, â\\x80\\x9cIt is above eight       months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were       all dancing together at Netherfield.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he       afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of       the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was       not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there       was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.        It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy       himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an       expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she       heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his       companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners       which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence       might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus       seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people       with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a       disgraceâ\\x80\\x94when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to       the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected       their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonageâ\\x80\\x94the difference, the       change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she       could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never,       even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his       dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to       please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as       now, when no importance could result from the success of his       endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his       attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and       censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.        Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they       arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in       expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss       Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.       Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in       the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner       looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the       invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance,       but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that       this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment       than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who       was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she       ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next       was fixed on.        Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing       Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and       many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.       Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak       of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some       others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of       considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though       while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager       to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and       aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their       favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.        But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s curiosity;       it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident       that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had       before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love       with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify       enquiry.        Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,       as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.       They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn       his character from their own feelings and his servantâ\\x80\\x99s report,       without any reference to any other account, the circle in       Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it       for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing       the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority       of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and       whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily       rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of       their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.       They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably       had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants       of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was       acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much       good among the poor.        With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was       not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his       concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood,       it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he       had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards       discharged.        As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening       more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it       seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings       towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours       endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him.       No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been       ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so       called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable       qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some       time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now       heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony       so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in       so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,       above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of       goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;       gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving       her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony       of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations       accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would       avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental       meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any       indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where       their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good       opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his       sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only       astonishment but gratitudeâ\\x80\\x94for to love, ardent love, it must be       attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be       encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be       exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to       him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted       to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself,       and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should       employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed,       of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.        It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the       niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s in coming to       see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had       reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though       it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their       side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to       wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were,       therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked       herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.        Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme       had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made       of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.     Chapter 45        Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s dislike of her       had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how       unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was       curious to know with how much civility on that ladyâ\\x80\\x99s side the       acquaintance would now be renewed.        On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the       saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.       Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing       view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the       beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over       the intermediate lawn.        In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting       there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom       she lived in London. Georgianaâ\\x80\\x99s reception of them was very       civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though       proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily       give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her       being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however,       did her justice, and pitied her.        By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a       curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such       pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first       broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman,       whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to       be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between       her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the       conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished       for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a       short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.        Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss       Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss       Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not       have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they       not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not       sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts       were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the       gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the       master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished       or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in       this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s       voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry       after the health of her family. She answered with equal       indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.        The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the       entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all       the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till       after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to       Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was       now employment for the whole partyâ\\x80\\x94for though they could not all       talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,       nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.        While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding       whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.       Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;       and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes       to predominate, she began to regret that he came.        He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three       other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had       left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended       a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than       Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;       a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the       more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the       whole party were awakened against them, and that there was       scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first       came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so       strongly marked as in Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s, in spite of the smiles       which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its       objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her       attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her       brotherâ\\x80\\x99s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and       Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to       get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt       at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this       likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first       opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:        â\\x80\\x9cPray, Miss Eliza, are not the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire Militia removed from       Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family.â\\x80\\x9d        In Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s presence she dared not mention Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s name; but       Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her       thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave       her a momentâ\\x80\\x99s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel       the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a       tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance       showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking       at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to       lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then       giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained       from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose       Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she       believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which       might injure her in Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the       latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of       her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had       ever reached her of Miss Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s meditated elopement. To no       creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except       to Elizabeth; and from all Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s connections her brother was       particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which       Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming       hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and       without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate       him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something       to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.        Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his       emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not       approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,       though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother,       whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest       in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed       to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on       her more and more cheerfully.        Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer       above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their       carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on       Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not       join her. Her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s recommendation was enough to ensure her       favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such       terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of       finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy       returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to       him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.        â\\x80\\x9cHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,â\\x80\\x9d       she cried; â\\x80\\x9cI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she       is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and       I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.â\\x80\\x9d        However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he       contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other       alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous       consequence of travelling in the summer.        â\\x80\\x9cFor my own part,â\\x80\\x9d she rejoined, â\\x80\\x9cI must confess that I never       could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion       has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her       nose wants characterâ\\x80\\x94there is nothing marked in its lines. Her       teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for       her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never       see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish       look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there       is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.â\\x80\\x9d        Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this       was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people       are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat       nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely       silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak,       she continued:        â\\x80\\x9cI remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed       we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I       particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been       dining at Netherfield, â\\x80\\x98_She_ a beauty!â\\x80\\x94I should as soon call her       mother a wit.â\\x80\\x99 But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I       believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, â\\x80\\x9cbut       _that_ was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since       I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my       acquaintance.â\\x80\\x9d        He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the       satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any       pain but herself.        Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred       during their visit, as they returned, except what had       particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of       everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who       had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister,       his friends, his house, his fruitâ\\x80\\x94of everything but himself; yet       Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him,       and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieceâ\\x80\\x99s       beginning the subject.     Chapter 46        Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a       letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this       disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had       now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and       her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at       once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent       elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written       the direction remarkably ill.        They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and       her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off       by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had       been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of       all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the       country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day       later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important       intelligence. It was to this effect:        â\\x80\\x9cSince writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred       of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of       alarming youâ\\x80\\x94be assured that we are all well. What I have to say       relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just       as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us       that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to       own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty,       however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very       sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to       hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.       Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this       step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His       choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can       give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father       bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know       what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They       were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were       not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent       off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten       miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here       soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their       intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor       mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I       hardly know what I have written.â\\x80\\x9d        Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely       knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter       instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost       impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than       the conclusion of the first.        â\\x80\\x9cBy this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried       letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not       confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer       for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would       write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.       Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia       would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place,       for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to       Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton       the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s       short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were       going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing       his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia       at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking       the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did       trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering       that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the       chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this       is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not       what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side       London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing       them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and       Hatfield, but without any successâ\\x80\\x94no such people had been seen to       pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,       and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to       his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one       can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very       great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think       so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for       them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first       plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young       woman of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose       her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,       that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he       shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.       was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and       keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but       this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my       life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having       concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,       one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have       been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as       the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?       I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if       inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have       just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I       cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as       possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not       afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to       ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel       Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I       am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him       to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel       Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In       such an exigence, my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s advice and assistance would be       everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I       must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! where, where is my uncle?â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, darting from her       seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,       without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she       reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy       appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and       before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind       every idea was superseded by Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s situation, hastily       exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find       Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I       have not an instant to lose.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cGood God! what is the matter?â\\x80\\x9d cried he, with more feeling than       politeness; then recollecting himself, â\\x80\\x9cI will not detain you a       minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.       Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she       felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.       Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though       in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to       fetch his master and mistress home instantly.        On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself,       and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to       leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and       commiseration, â\\x80\\x9cLet me call your maid. Is there nothing you could       take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you       one? You are very ill.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, I thank you,â\\x80\\x9d she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.       â\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only       distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from       Longbourn.â\\x80\\x9d        She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes       could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could       only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her       in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. â\\x80\\x9cI have just       had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be       concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her       friendsâ\\x80\\x94has eloped; has thrown herself into the power ofâ\\x80\\x94of Mr.       Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him       too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,       nothing that can tempt him toâ\\x80\\x94she is lost for ever.â\\x80\\x9d        Darcy was fixed in astonishment. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I consider,â\\x80\\x9d she added in       a yet more agitated voice, â\\x80\\x9cthat _I_ might have prevented it! _I_       who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it       onlyâ\\x80\\x94some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his       character been known, this could not have happened. But it is       allâ\\x80\\x94all too late now.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am grieved indeed,â\\x80\\x9d cried Darcy; â\\x80\\x9cgrievedâ\\x80\\x94shocked. But is it       certainâ\\x80\\x94absolutely certain?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were       traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not       gone to Scotland.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover       her?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my       uncleâ\\x80\\x99s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in       half-an-hour. But nothing can be doneâ\\x80\\x94I know very well that       nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are       they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is       every way horrible!â\\x80\\x9d        Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.        â\\x80\\x9cWhen _my_ eyes were opened to his real characterâ\\x80\\x94Oh! had I known       what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew notâ\\x80\\x94I was afraid of       doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!â\\x80\\x9d        Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was       walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow       contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and       instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything _must_       sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of       the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but       the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to       her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the       contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own       wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have       loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.        But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.       Lydiaâ\\x80\\x94the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all,       soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with       her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else;       and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a       sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a       manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise       restraint, said, â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid you have been long desiring my       absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but       real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything       could be either said or done on my part that might offer       consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with       vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.       This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s having       the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say       that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the       unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be       long.â\\x80\\x9d        He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow       for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was       at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her       relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.        As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that       they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality       as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she       threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their       acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at       the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted       its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its       termination.        If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,       Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor       faulty. But if otherwiseâ\\x80\\x94if regard springing from such sources is       unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often       described as arising on a first interview with its object, and       even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in       her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the       latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill       success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less       interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go       with regret; and in this early example of what Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s infamy       must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that       wretched business. Never, since reading Janeâ\\x80\\x99s second letter, had       she entertained a hope of Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s meaning to marry her. No one       but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an       expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this       development. While the contents of the first letter remained in       her mind, she was all surpriseâ\\x80\\x94all astonishment that Wickham       should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for       money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared       incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an       attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though       she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an       elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no       difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her       understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.        She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,       that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that       Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.       Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite,       as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections       had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The       mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a       girlâ\\x80\\x94oh! how acutely did she now feel it!        She was wild to be at homeâ\\x80\\x94to hear, to see, to be upon the spot       to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon       her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable       of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost       persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncleâ\\x80\\x99s       interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered       the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had       hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servantâ\\x80\\x99s account that       their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly       on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their       summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the       postscript of the last with trembling energy.â\\x80\\x94 Though Lydia had       never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not       but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned       in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror,       Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth,       though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude;       and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating       to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as       soon as possible. â\\x80\\x9cBut what is to be done about Pemberley?â\\x80\\x9d cried       Mrs. Gardiner. â\\x80\\x9cJohn told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for       us; was it so?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our       engagement. _That_ is all settled.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is all settled;â\\x80\\x9d repeated the other, as she ran into her       room to prepare. â\\x80\\x9cAnd are they upon such terms as for her to       disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!â\\x80\\x9d        But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her       in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth       been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that       all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but       she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst       the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at       Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour,       however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile       having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be       done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the       morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could       have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to       Longbourn.     Chapter 47        â\\x80\\x9cI have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,â\\x80\\x9d said her uncle,       as they drove from the town; â\\x80\\x9cand really, upon serious       consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as       your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very       unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a       girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was       actually staying in his colonelâ\\x80\\x99s family, that I am strongly       inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would       not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the       regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His       temptation is not adequate to the risk!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDo you really think so?â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a       moment.        â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Gardiner, â\\x80\\x9cI begin to be of your       uncleâ\\x80\\x99s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,       honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so       very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him       up, as to believe him capable of it?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNot, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other       neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so!       But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if       that had been the case?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIn the first place,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Gardiner, â\\x80\\x9cthere is no absolute       proof that they are not gone to Scotland.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is       such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be       found on the Barnet road.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWell, thenâ\\x80\\x94supposing them to be in London. They may be there,       though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional       purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on       either side; and it might strike them that they could be more       economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than       in Scotland.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must       their marriage be private? Oh, no, noâ\\x80\\x94this is not likely. His       most particular friend, you see by Janeâ\\x80\\x99s account, was persuaded       of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a       woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims       has Lydiaâ\\x80\\x94what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good       humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of       benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the       apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a       dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I       know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But       as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.       Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from       my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour, from his indolence and the little       attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in       his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little       about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love       of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than       marriage?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,â\\x80\\x9d replied       Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, â\\x80\\x9cthat a sisterâ\\x80\\x99s sense of       decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,       really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her       justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to       think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a       twelvemonthâ\\x80\\x94she has been given up to nothing but amusement and       vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most       idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in       her way. Since the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire were first quartered in Meryton,       nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head.       She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and       talking on the subject, to give greaterâ\\x80\\x94what shall I call it?       susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively       enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person       and address that can captivate a woman.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut you see that Jane,â\\x80\\x9d said her aunt, â\\x80\\x9cdoes not think so very       ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOf whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever       might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of       such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane       knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that       he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has       neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful       as he is insinuating.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd do you really know all this?â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose       curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.        â\\x80\\x9cI do indeed,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, colouring. â\\x80\\x9cI told you, the       other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you       yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke       of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality       towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at       libertyâ\\x80\\x94which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about       the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss       Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,       disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must       know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found       her.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what       you and Jane seem so well to understand?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes!â\\x80\\x94that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and       saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel       Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I       returned home, the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire was to leave Meryton in a week or       fortnightâ\\x80\\x99s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I       related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our       knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any       one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him       should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that       Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her       eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be       in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such       a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was       far enough from my thoughts.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhen they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason,       I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNot the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on       either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you       must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be       thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready       enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near       Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months;       but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention;       and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and       wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the       regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her       favourites.â\\x80\\x9d        It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could       be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this       interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could       detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From       Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the       keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval       of ease or forgetfulness.        They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one       night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.       It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not       have been wearied by long expectations.        The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were       standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;       and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise       that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their       whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first       pleasing earnest of their welcome.        Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty       kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running       down from her motherâ\\x80\\x99s apartment, immediately met her.        Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears       filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether       anything had been heard of the fugitives.        â\\x80\\x9cNot yet,â\\x80\\x9d replied Jane. â\\x80\\x9cBut now that my dear uncle is come, I       hope everything will be well.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIs my father in town?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd have you heard from him often?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday       to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his       directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely       added that he should not write again till he had something of       importance to mention.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd my motherâ\\x80\\x94how is she? How are you all?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are       greatly shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction       in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary       and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut youâ\\x80\\x94how are you?â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cYou look pale. How much       you must have gone through!â\\x80\\x9d        Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and       their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.       Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to       by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and       aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles       and tears.        When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which       Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the       others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to       give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence       of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still       expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would       bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain       their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.        Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few       minutesâ\\x80\\x99 conversation together, received them exactly as might be       expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives       against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her       own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to       whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must       principally be owing.        â\\x80\\x9cIf I had been able,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cto carry my point in going to       Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but       poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the       Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was       some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the       kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked       after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge       of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And       now hereâ\\x80\\x99s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight       Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and       what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out       before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,       brother, I do not know what we shall do.â\\x80\\x9d        They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,       after general assurances of his affection for her and all her       family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,       and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering       Lydia.        â\\x80\\x9cDo not give way to useless alarm,â\\x80\\x9d added he; â\\x80\\x9cthough it is right       to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it       as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a       few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know       that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not       let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I       shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to       Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what       is to be done.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear brother,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Bennet, â\\x80\\x9cthat is exactly what       I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find       them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married       already, _make_ them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not       let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much       money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And,       above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a       dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my witsâ\\x80\\x94and       have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over meâ\\x80\\x94such spasms       in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that       I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not       to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,       for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,       how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.â\\x80\\x9d        But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest       endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation       to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with       her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left       her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in       the absence of her daughters.        Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no       real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not       attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence       enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited       at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household,       and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her       fears and solicitude on the subject.        In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who       had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make       their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other       from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably       calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss       of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself       incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than       usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress       enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of       grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:        â\\x80\\x9cThis is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much       talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the       wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.â\\x80\\x9d        Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she       added, â\\x80\\x9cUnhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from       it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is       irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;       that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and       that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the       undeserving of the other sex.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much       oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console       herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before       them.        In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for       half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed       herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane       was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general       lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which       Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could       not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the       subject, by saying, â\\x80\\x9cBut tell me all and everything about it       which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What       did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything       before the elopement took place? They must have seen them       together for ever.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cColonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some       partiality, especially on Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s side, but nothing to give him       any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive       and kind to the utmost. He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure       us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone       to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened       his journey.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he       know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny       himself?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing       anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion       about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not       marryingâ\\x80\\x94and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have       been misunderstood before.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you       entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I       felt a little uneasyâ\\x80\\x94a little fearful of my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s happiness       with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not       been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of       that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then       owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest       of us, that in Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s last letter she had prepared her for such       a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each       other, many weeks.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut not before they went to Brighton?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, I believe not.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?       Does he know his real character?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he       formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.       And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he       left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of       him, this could not have happened!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it would have been better,â\\x80\\x9d replied her sister. â\\x80\\x9cBut to       expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their       present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the       best intentions.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCould Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s note to       his wife?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHe brought it with him for us to see.â\\x80\\x9d        Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.       These were the contents:        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Harriet,       â\\x80\\x9cYou will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help       laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I       am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess       with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man       in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy       without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send       them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it       will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign       my name â\\x80\\x98Lydia Wickham.â\\x80\\x99 What a good joke it will be! I can       hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not       keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I       hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will       dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I       shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you       would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown       before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel       Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.        â\\x80\\x9cYour affectionate friend,       â\\x80\\x9cLYDIA BENNET.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth when she       had finished it. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a letter is this, to be written at such a       moment! But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the       subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade       her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor       father! how he must have felt it!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for       full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the       whole house in such confusion!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! Jane,â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cwas there a servant belonging to it       who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a       time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I       endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid       I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what       might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not       look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care       and anxiety upon yourself alone.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in       every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either       of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,       that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt       Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away;       and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of       great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very       kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us,       and offered her services, or any of her daughtersâ\\x80\\x99, if they       should be of use to us.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe had better have stayed at home,â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cperhaps       she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one       cannot see too little of oneâ\\x80\\x99s neighbours. Assistance is       impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at       a distance, and be satisfied.â\\x80\\x9d        She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father       had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his       daughter.        â\\x80\\x9cHe meant I believe,â\\x80\\x9d replied Jane, â\\x80\\x9cto go to Epsom, the place       where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if       anything could be made out from them. His principal object must       be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them       from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he       thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladyâ\\x80\\x99s removing       from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make       enquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house       the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make       enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out       the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other       designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be       gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had       difficulty in finding out even so much as this.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 48        The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the       next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line       from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a       most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time       they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he       had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of _that_ they       would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only       for the letters before he set off.        When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving       constant information of what was going on, and their uncle       promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to       Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his       sister, who considered it as the only security for her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s       not being killed in a duel.        Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a       few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be       serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs.       Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of       freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and       always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening       them upâ\\x80\\x94though, as she never came without reporting some fresh       instance of Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom       went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found       them.        All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three       months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared       to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues,       all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into       every tradesmanâ\\x80\\x99s family. Everybody declared that he was the       wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out       that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.       Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said,       believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s ruin       more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it,       became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come       when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before       entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained       some news of them.        Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife       received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he       had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come       to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and       Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory       information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the       principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they       might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London,       before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not       expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was       eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that       Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London       and promised to write again very soon. There was also a       postscript to this effect:        â\\x80\\x9cI have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if       possible, from some of the young manâ\\x80\\x99s intimates in the regiment,       whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be       likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself.       If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability       of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential       consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel       Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy       us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could       tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other       person.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference       to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give       any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment       deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations,       except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many       years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in       the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire might be able to give more information; and though       she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a       something to look forward to.        Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most       anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival       of letters was the grand object of every morningâ\\x80\\x99s impatience.       Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be       communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some       news of importance.        But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived       for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;       which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for       him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew       what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and       read it likewise. It was as follows:        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Sir,       â\\x80\\x9cI feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation       in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are       now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a       letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.       Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your       respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of       the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time       can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can       alleviate so severe a misfortuneâ\\x80\\x94or that may comfort you, under a       circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a       parentâ\\x80\\x99s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a       blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be       lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte       informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your       daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;       though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and       Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must       be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity,       at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to       be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins,       but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have       related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this       false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of       all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself       condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?       And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with       augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for       had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your       sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console       yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child       from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of       her own heinous offense.        â\\x80\\x9cI am, dear sir, etc., etc.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer       from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant       nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single       relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was       certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances       had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did       not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any       of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as       likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his       own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in       addition to his fear of discovery by Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s relations, for it       had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a       very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than       a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at       Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour       were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to       conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard       them with horror. â\\x80\\x9cA gamester!â\\x80\\x9d she cried. â\\x80\\x9cThis is wholly       unexpected. I had not an idea of it.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see       their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.       Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours,       he had yielded to his brother-in-lawâ\\x80\\x99s entreaty that he would       return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion       might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When       Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much       satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her       anxiety for his life had been before.        â\\x80\\x9cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?â\\x80\\x9d she cried.       â\\x80\\x9cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is       to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?â\\x80\\x9d        As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that       she and the children should go to London, at the same time that       Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the       first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to       Longbourn.        Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and       her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the       world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them       by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.       Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from       him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her       return that could come from Pemberley.        The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse       for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore,       could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who       was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings,       was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she       could have borne the dread of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s infamy somewhat better. It       would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of       two.        When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual       philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in       the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had       taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had       courage to speak of it.        It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,       that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on       her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured,       he replied, â\\x80\\x9cSay nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself?       It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou must not be too severe upon yourself,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth.        â\\x80\\x9cYou may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so       prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how       much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered       by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDo you suppose them to be in London?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; where else can they be so well concealed?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd Lydia used to want to go to London,â\\x80\\x9d added Kitty.        â\\x80\\x9cShe is happy then,â\\x80\\x9d said her father drily; â\\x80\\x9cand her residence       there will probably be of some duration.â\\x80\\x9d        Then after a short silence he continued:        â\\x80\\x9cLizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice       to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some       greatness of mind.â\\x80\\x9d        They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her       motherâ\\x80\\x99s tea.        â\\x80\\x9cThis is a parade,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9cwhich does one good; it gives such       an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will       sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as       much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty       runs away.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am not going to run away, papa,â\\x80\\x9d said Kitty fretfully. â\\x80\\x9cIf _I_       should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9c_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as       Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to       be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is       ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the       village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up       with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors       till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day       in a rational manner.â\\x80\\x9d        Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to       cry.        â\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cdo not make yourself unhappy. If you are       a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review       at the end of them.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 49        Two days after Mr. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were       walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the       housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to       call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead       of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to       Miss Bennet, â\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but       I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I       took the liberty of coming to ask.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDear madam,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you       know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He       has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.â\\x80\\x9d        Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.       They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from       thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were       on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when       they were met by the butler, who said:        â\\x80\\x9cIf you are looking for my master, maâ\\x80\\x99am, he is walking towards       the little copse.â\\x80\\x9d        Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall       once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was       deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of       the paddock.        Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as       Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for       breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:        â\\x80\\x9cOh, papa, what newsâ\\x80\\x94what news? Have you heard from my uncle?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes I have had a letter from him by express.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWell, and what news does it bringâ\\x80\\x94good or bad?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat is there of good to be expected?â\\x80\\x9d said he, taking the       letter from his pocket. â\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps you would like to read it.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.        â\\x80\\x9cRead it aloud,â\\x80\\x9d said their father, â\\x80\\x9cfor I hardly know myself       what it is about.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cGracechurch Street, _Monday, August_ 2.        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Brother,       â\\x80\\x9cAt last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such       as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon       after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out       in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till       we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen       them bothâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d           â\\x80\\x9cThen it is as I always hoped,â\\x80\\x9d cried Jane; â\\x80\\x9cthey are           married!â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth read on:        â\\x80\\x9cI have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find       there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to       perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your       side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is       required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,       her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your       children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,       moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during       your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions       which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying       with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall       send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me       your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,       that Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are       generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that       respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money,       even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in       addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case,       you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole       of this business, I will immediately give directions to       Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be       the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore       stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.       Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write       explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be       married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She       comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more       is determined on. Yours, etc.,        â\\x80\\x9cEDW. GARDINER.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIs it possible?â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. â\\x80\\x9cCan it       be possible that he will marry her?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,â\\x80\\x9d said       her sister. â\\x80\\x9cMy dear father, I congratulate you.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd have you answered the letter?â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth.        â\\x80\\x9cNo; but it must be done soon.â\\x80\\x9d        Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time       before he wrote.        â\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear father,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9ccome back and write       immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a       case.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLet me write for you,â\\x80\\x9d said Jane, â\\x80\\x9cif you dislike the trouble       yourself.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI dislike it very much,â\\x80\\x9d he replied; â\\x80\\x9cbut it must be done.â\\x80\\x9d        And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the       house.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd may I askâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cbut the terms, I suppose, must       be complied with.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cComplied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But       there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how       much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the       other, how am I ever to pay him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMoney! My uncle!â\\x80\\x9d cried Jane, â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you mean, sir?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight       a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty       after I am gone.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is very true,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cthough it had not occurred       to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to       remain! Oh! it must be my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s doings! Generous, good man, I       am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all       this.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said her father; â\\x80\\x9cWickhamâ\\x80\\x99s a fool if he takes her with a       farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to       think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be       repaid?â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,       continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then       went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the       breakfast-room.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd they are really to be married!â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, as soon as       they were by themselves. â\\x80\\x9cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we       are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their       chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are       forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI comfort myself with thinking,â\\x80\\x9d replied Jane, â\\x80\\x9cthat he       certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for       her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing       him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like       it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have       more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf he were ever able to learn what Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s debts have been,â\\x80\\x9d       said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cand how much is settled on his side on our       sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for       them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness       of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her       home, and affording her their personal protection and       countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of       gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually       with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she       will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she       first sees my aunt!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,â\\x80\\x9d       said Jane: â\\x80\\x9cI hope and trust they will yet be happy. His       consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is       come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will       steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,       and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past       imprudence forgotten.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTheir conduct has been such,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cas neither       you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of       it.â\\x80\\x9d        It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all       likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to       the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would       not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and,       without raising his head, coolly replied:        â\\x80\\x9cJust as you please.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMay we take my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s letter to read to her?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTake whatever you like, and get away.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went       up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:       one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight       preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet       could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr.       Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s hope of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s being soon married, her joy burst       forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She       was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever       been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter       would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her       felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear, dear Lydia!â\\x80\\x9d she cried. â\\x80\\x9cThis is delightful indeed! She       will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at       sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he       would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear       Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write       to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run       down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay,       stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will       put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we       shall be together when we meet!â\\x80\\x9d        Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the       violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the       obligations which Mr. Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour laid them all under.        â\\x80\\x9cFor we must attribute this happy conclusion,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cin a       great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has       pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, â\\x80\\x9cit is all very right; who should do it       but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and       my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the       first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few       presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a       daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was       only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter,       that I am sure I canâ\\x80\\x99t write; so I will dictate, and you write       for me. We will settle with your father about the money       afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.â\\x80\\x9d        She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,       and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful       orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her       to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One dayâ\\x80\\x99s       delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother       was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,       too, came into her head.        â\\x80\\x9cI will go to Meryton,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cas soon as I am dressed, and       tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come       back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and       order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I       am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here       comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss       Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of       punch to make merry at her wedding.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received       her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this       folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with       freedom.        Poor Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it       was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and       though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor       worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in       looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she       felt all the advantages of what they had gained.     Chapter 50        Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life       that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an       annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his       wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had       he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been       indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now       be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of       the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband       might then have rested in its proper place.        He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to       anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his       brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out       the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as       soon as he could.        When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be       perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The       son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should       be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means       be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world,       but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years       after Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s birth, had been certain that he would. This event       had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be       saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s       love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their       income.        Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.       Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be       divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.       This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now       to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in       acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful       acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed       most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect       approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil       the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before       supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his       daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to       himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten       pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them;       for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual       presents in money which passed to her through her motherâ\\x80\\x99s hands,       Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s expenses had been very little within that sum.        That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,       too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present       was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When       the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in       seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former       indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory       in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged       to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his       brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.        The good news spread quickly through the house, and with       proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in       the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been       more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come       upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded       from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to       be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her       well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old       ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this       change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery       was considered certain.        It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on       this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,       and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a       damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been       the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on       the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran       wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new       carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the       neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and,       without knowing or considering what their income might be,       rejected many as deficient in size and importance.        â\\x80\\x9cHaye Park might do,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cif the Gouldings could quit       itâ\\x80\\x94or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;       but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten       miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.â\\x80\\x9d        Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the       servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her:       â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your       son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into       _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have       admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by       receiving them at Longbourn.â\\x80\\x9d        A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was       firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with       amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea       to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should       receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.       Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be       carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse       his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would       scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She       was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must       reflect on her daughterâ\\x80\\x99s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at       her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took       place.        Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the       distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted       with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so       shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might       hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who       were not immediately on the spot.        She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There       were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently       depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge       of a sisterâ\\x80\\x99s frailty would have mortified her so muchâ\\x80\\x94not,       however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to       herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between       them. Had Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s marriage been concluded on the most honourable       terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect       himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now       be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a       man whom he so justly scorned.        From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.       The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself       of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation       survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved;       she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous       of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by       it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance       of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have       been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should       meet.        What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that       the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago,       would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was       as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex;       but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.        She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in       disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding       and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her       wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of       both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been       softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement,       information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received       benefit of greater importance.        But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude       what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different       tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon       to be formed in their family.        How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable       independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent       happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together       because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could       easily conjecture.        Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s       acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his       eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and       concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be       mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was       to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the       militia.        â\\x80\\x9cIt was greatly my wish that he should do so,â\\x80\\x9d he added, â\\x80\\x9cas soon       as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me,       in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,       both on his account and my nieceâ\\x80\\x99s. It is Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s intention       to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are       still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He       has the promise of an ensigncy in General â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99s regiment, now       quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from       this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among       different people, where they may each have a character to       preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to       Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and       to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.       Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment,       for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the       trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in       Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his       information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he       has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will       be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless       they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.       Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before       she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully       remembered to you and her mother.â\\x80\\x94Yours, etc.,        â\\x80\\x9cE. GARDINER.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s       removal from the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But       Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s being       settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure       and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her       plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe       disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia       should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with       everybody, and had so many favourites.        â\\x80\\x9cShe is so fond of Mrs. Forster,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cit will be quite       shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young       men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so       pleasant in General â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99s regiment.â\\x80\\x9d        His daughterâ\\x80\\x99s request, for such it might be considered, of being       admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,       received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,       who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sisterâ\\x80\\x99s feelings       and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by       her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so       mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as       they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they       thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the       satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her       married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to       the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,       he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that       as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to       Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should       consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own       inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object       of her wishes.     Chapter 51        Their sisterâ\\x80\\x99s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt       for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was       sent to meet them at â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94, and they were to return in it by       dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets,       and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would       have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, and was       wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.        They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to       receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the       carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably       grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.        Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown       open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards,       embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with       an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and       wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of       their happiness.        Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was       not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;       and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young       couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was       disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia       still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned       from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when       at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took       notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a       laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.        Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his       manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his       marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy       address, while he claimed their relationship, would have       delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite       equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within       herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an       impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of       the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of       colour.        There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could       neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to       sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in       that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very       unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have       the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was       recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects       which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.        â\\x80\\x9cOnly think of its being three months,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9csince I went       away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been       things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went       away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came       back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.â\\x80\\x9d        Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth       looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw       anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,       â\\x80\\x9cOh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I       was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in       his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let       down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let       my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the       ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the       room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through       the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough       to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her motherâ\\x80\\x99s right       hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, â\\x80\\x9cAh! Jane, I take       your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married       woman.â\\x80\\x9d        It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that       embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.       Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs.       Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to       hear herself called â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x9d by each of them; and in the       mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of       being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.        â\\x80\\x9cWell, mamma,â\\x80\\x9d said she, when they were all returned to the       breakfast room, â\\x80\\x9cand what do you think of my husband? Is not he a       charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope       they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton.       That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we       did not all go.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cVery true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I       donâ\\x80\\x99t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, lord! yes;â\\x80\\x94there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all       things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.       We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there       will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for       them all.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI should like it beyond anything!â\\x80\\x9d said her mother.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my       sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them       before the winter is over.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI thank you for my share of the favour,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cbut I       do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.â\\x80\\x9d        Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr.       Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he       was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.        No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so       short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with       her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These       parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even       more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.        Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had       expected to find it; not equal to Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s for him. She had       scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the       reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the       strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have       wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope       with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was       rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were       the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of       having a companion.        Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on       every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He       did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill       more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the       country.        One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with       her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:        â\\x80\\x9cLizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.       You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.       Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo really,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cI think there cannot be too       little said on the subject.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLa! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We       were married, you know, at St. Clementâ\\x80\\x99s, because Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s       lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should       all be there by eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to       go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,       Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,       you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I       should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the       time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she       was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in       ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I       longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWell, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would       never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my       uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with       them. If youâ\\x80\\x99ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of       doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme,       or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the       Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came       to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that       horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get       together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did       not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we       were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,       luckily, he came back again in ten minutesâ\\x80\\x99 time, and then we all       set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been       prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy       might have done as well.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy!â\\x80\\x9d repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.        â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes!â\\x80\\x94he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But       gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word       about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?       It was to be such a secret!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf it was to be secret,â\\x80\\x9d said Jane, â\\x80\\x9csay not another word on the       subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! certainly,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;       â\\x80\\x9cwe will ask you no questions.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d said Lydia, â\\x80\\x9cfor if you did, I should certainly tell       you all, and then Wickham would be angry.â\\x80\\x9d        On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out       of her power, by running away.        But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at       least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had       been at her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly       among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least       temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and       wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.       Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the       noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such       suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short       letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had       dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been       intended.        â\\x80\\x9cYou may readily comprehend,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cwhat my curiosity must       be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and       (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have       been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me       understand itâ\\x80\\x94unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in       the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must       endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNot that I _shall_, though,â\\x80\\x9d she added to herself, as she       finished the letter; â\\x80\\x9cand my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in       an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and       stratagems to find it out.â\\x80\\x9d        Janeâ\\x80\\x99s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to       Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was       glad of it;â\\x80\\x94till it appeared whether her enquiries would receive       any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.     Chapter 52        Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her       letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in       possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she       was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the       benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter       convinced her that it did not contain a denial.        â\\x80\\x9cGracechurch Street, _Sept_. 6.        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Niece,        â\\x80\\x9cI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole       morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing       will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself       surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.       Donâ\\x80\\x99t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know       that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_       side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my       impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I amâ\\x80\\x94and nothing       but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed       him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and       ignorant, I must be more explicit.        â\\x80\\x9cOn the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had       a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with       him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my       curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have       been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where       your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked       with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can       collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and       came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive       professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that       Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it       impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in       him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and       confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his       private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for       itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and       endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.       If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace       him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to       discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which       was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another       reason for his resolving to follow us.        â\\x80\\x9cThere is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago       governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on       some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She       then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since       maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he       knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for       intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or       three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would       not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption,       for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham       indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had       she been able to receive them into her house, they would have       taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind       friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 street.       He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His       first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her       to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her       friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,       offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found       Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared       for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not       hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some       time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were       her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and       expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with       Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He       confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of       some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not       to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s flight on her own       folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and       as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about       it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew       he should have nothing to live on.        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.       Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have       been able to do something for him, and his situation must have       been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this       question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more       effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.       Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof       against the temptation of immediate relief.        â\\x80\\x9cThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed.       Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length       was reduced to be reasonable.        â\\x80\\x9cEverything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s next step       was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in       Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr.       Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further       enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town       the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person       whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore       readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the       former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was       only known that a gentleman had called on business.        â\\x80\\x9cOn Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at       home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk       together.        â\\x80\\x9cThey met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not       all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was       sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I       fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,       after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times,       but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did       not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be       thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most       readily have settled the whole.        â\\x80\\x9cThey battled it together for a long time, which was more than       either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at       last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed       to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having       the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain;       and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great       pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him       of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.       But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at       most.        â\\x80\\x9cYou know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the       young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to       considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in       addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission       purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone,       was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his       reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s       character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had       been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth       in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s_       reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all       this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured       that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him       credit for _another interest_ in the affair.        â\\x80\\x9cWhen all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends,       who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he       should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and       all money matters were then to receive the last finish.        â\\x80\\x9cI believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation       which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least       it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and       Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was exactly       what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would       not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour       while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Janeâ\\x80\\x99s letter       last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a       piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no       fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious       manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had       done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If       she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not       listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my       dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with       her.        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,       attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to       leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry       with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying       (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.       His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as       when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all       please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and       _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him. I       thought him very sly;â\\x80\\x94he hardly ever mentioned your name. But       slyness seems the fashion.        â\\x80\\x9cPray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do       not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be       quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton,       with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.        â\\x80\\x9cBut I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this       half hour.        â\\x80\\x9cYours, very sincerely,       â\\x80\\x9cM. GARDINER.â\\x80\\x9d        The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of       spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure       or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled       suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might       have been doing to forward her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s match, which she had       feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be       probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain       of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be       true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on       himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a       research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman       whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to       meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe,       the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name       it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a       girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did       whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly       checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her       vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection       for herâ\\x80\\x94for a woman who had already refused himâ\\x80\\x94as able to       overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against       relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind       of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure,       done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a       reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch       of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been       wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it;       and though she would not place herself as his principal       inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality       for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of       mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly       painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who       could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia,       her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she       grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,       every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself       she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause       of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of       himself. She read over her auntâ\\x80\\x99s commendation of him again and       again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even       sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding       how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that       affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.        She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some oneâ\\x80\\x99s       approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was       overtaken by Wickham.        â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?â\\x80\\x9d       said he, as he joined her.        â\\x80\\x9cYou certainly do,â\\x80\\x9d she replied with a smile; â\\x80\\x9cbut it does not       follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI should be sorry indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good       friends; and now we are better.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTrue. Are the others coming out?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage       to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and       aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.â\\x80\\x9d        She replied in the affirmative.        â\\x80\\x9cI almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be       too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.       And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she       was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my       name to you.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, she did.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd what did she say?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat you were gone into the army, and she was afraid hadâ\\x80\\x94not       turned out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things       are strangely misrepresented.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cCertainly,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had       silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:        â\\x80\\x9cI was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each       other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,â\\x80\\x9d said       Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cIt must be something particular, to take him there at       this time of year.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I       thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes; he introduced us to his sister.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd do you like her?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cVery much.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within       this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very       promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out       well.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDid you go by the village of Kympton?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not recollect that we did.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have       had. A most delightful place!â\\x80\\x94Excellent Parsonage House! It would       have suited me in every respect.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow should you have liked making sermons?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cExceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my       duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought       not to repine;â\\x80\\x94but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing       for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have       answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you       ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that       it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the       present patron.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from       the first, you may remember.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was       not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you       actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and       that the business had been compromised accordingly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may       remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of       it.â\\x80\\x9d        They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked       fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sisterâ\\x80\\x99s sake, to       provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:        â\\x80\\x9cCome, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not       let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be       always of one mind.â\\x80\\x9d        She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry,       though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.     Chapter 53        Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation       that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear       sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was       pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.        The day of his and Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet       was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no       means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle,       was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.        â\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear Lydia,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9cwhen shall we meet again?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, lord! I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWrite to me very often, my dear.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAs often as I can. But you know married women have never much       time for writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have       nothing else to do.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Wickhamâ\\x80\\x99s adieus were much more affectionate than his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s.       He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.        â\\x80\\x9cHe is as fine a fellow,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were       out of the house, â\\x80\\x9cas ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and       makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even       Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.â\\x80\\x9d        The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several       days.        â\\x80\\x9cI often think,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cthat there is nothing so bad as       parting with oneâ\\x80\\x99s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThis is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a       daughter,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cIt must make you better satisfied       that your other four are single.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is       married, but only because her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s regiment happens to be so       far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so       soon.â\\x80\\x9d        But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was       shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of       hope, by an article of news which then began to be in       circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders       to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in       a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was       quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook       her head by turns.        â\\x80\\x9cWell, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,â\\x80\\x9d (for       Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). â\\x80\\x9cWell, so much the       better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us,       you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But,       however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes       it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us.       You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word       about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou may depend on it,â\\x80\\x9d replied the other, â\\x80\\x9cfor Mrs. Nicholls was       in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself       on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was       certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very       likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcherâ\\x80\\x99s, she told me,       on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got       three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.â\\x80\\x9d        Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without       changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his       name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together,       she said:        â\\x80\\x9cI saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the       present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But donâ\\x80\\x99t       imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the       moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure       you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or       pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we       shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but       I dread other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s remarks.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him       in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming       there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she       still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the       greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friendâ\\x80\\x99s       permission, or being bold enough to come without it.        â\\x80\\x9cYet it is hard,â\\x80\\x9d she sometimes thought, â\\x80\\x9cthat this poor man       cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without       raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.â\\x80\\x9d        In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be       her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could       easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were       more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.        The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their       parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.        â\\x80\\x9cAs soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet,       â\\x80\\x9cyou will wait on him of course.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised,       if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it       ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a foolâ\\x80\\x99s errand       again.â\\x80\\x9d        His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an       attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his       returning to Netherfield.        â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cIf he wants our       society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not       spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they       go away and come back again.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWell, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do       not wait on him. But, however, that shanâ\\x80\\x99t prevent my asking him       to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the       Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there       will be just room at table for him.â\\x80\\x9d        Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her       husbandâ\\x80\\x99s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that       her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it,       before _they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,â\\x80\\x94        â\\x80\\x9cI begin to be sorry that he comes at all,â\\x80\\x9d said Jane to her       sister. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be nothing; I could see him with perfect       indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually       talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one       can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be,       when his stay at Netherfield is over!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI wish I could say anything to comfort you,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth;       â\\x80\\x9cbut it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the       usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied       me, because you have always so much.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of       servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the       period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as       it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their       invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on       the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw       him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride       towards the house.        Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane       resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy       her mother, went to the windowâ\\x80\\x94she looked,â\\x80\\x94she saw Mr. Darcy with       him, and sat down again by her sister.        â\\x80\\x9cThere is a gentleman with him, mamma,â\\x80\\x9d said Kitty; â\\x80\\x9cwho can it       be?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cSome acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do       not know.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLa!â\\x80\\x9d replied Kitty, â\\x80\\x9cit looks just like that man that used to be       with him before. Mr. whatâ\\x80\\x99s-his-name. That tall, proud man.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!â\\x80\\x94and so it does, I vow. Well, any       friend of Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s will always be welcome here, to be sure;       but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.â\\x80\\x9d        Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but       little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the       awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost       for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both       sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and       of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her       dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only       as Mr. Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s friend, without being heard by either of them.       But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be       suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew       Mrs. Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment       towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she       had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own       more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole       family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she       regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at       least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her       astonishment at his comingâ\\x80\\x94at his coming to Netherfield, to       Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to       what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in       Derbyshire.        The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half       a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added       lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that       his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would       not be secure.        â\\x80\\x9cLet me first see how he behaves,â\\x80\\x9d said she; â\\x80\\x9cit will then be       early enough for expectation.â\\x80\\x9d        She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without       daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them       to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the       door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than       Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemenâ\\x80\\x99s appearing, her colour       increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a       propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of       resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.        Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and       sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not       often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He       looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been       used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at       Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her motherâ\\x80\\x99s presence be       what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not       an improbable, conjecture.        Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short       period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was       received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her       two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold       and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his       friend.        Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the       latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from       irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful       degree by a distinction so ill applied.        Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a       question which she could not answer without confusion, said       scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the       reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.       There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.       But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his       voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of       curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found       him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object       but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please,       than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was       disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.        â\\x80\\x9cCould I expect it to be otherwise!â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cYet why did he       come?â\\x80\\x9d        She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;       and to him she had hardly courage to speak.        She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.        â\\x80\\x9cIt is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.       Bennet.        He readily agreed to it.        â\\x80\\x9cI began to be afraid you would never come back again. People       _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;       but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have       happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is       married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you       have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It       was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put       in as it ought to be. It was only said, â\\x80\\x98Lately, George Wickham,       Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,â\\x80\\x99 without there being a syllable said       of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was       my brother Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to       make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?â\\x80\\x9d        Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.       Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,       therefore, she could not tell.        â\\x80\\x9cIt is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well       married,â\\x80\\x9d continued her mother, â\\x80\\x9cbut at the same time, Mr.       Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.       They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it       seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His       regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving       the â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank       Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he       deserves.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such       misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew       from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else       had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he       meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he       believed.        â\\x80\\x9cWhen you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,â\\x80\\x9d said her       mother, â\\x80\\x9cI beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you       please on Mr. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy       to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious       attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had       flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would       be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant,       she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself       amends for moments of such painful confusion.        â\\x80\\x9cThe first wish of my heart,â\\x80\\x9d said she to herself, â\\x80\\x9cis never more       to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no       pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me       never see either one or the other again!â\\x80\\x9d        Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no       compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from       observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the       admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had       spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be       giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she       had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though       not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should       be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she       talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that       she did not always know when she was silent.        When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of       her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine       at Longbourn in a few days time.        â\\x80\\x9cYou are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cfor       when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family       dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you       see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did       not come back and keep your engagement.â\\x80\\x9d        Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said       something of his concern at having been prevented by business.       They then went away.        Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and       dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good       table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be       good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or       satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a       year.     Chapter 54        As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her       spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on       those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour       astonished and vexed her.        â\\x80\\x9cWhy, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,â\\x80\\x9d said       she, â\\x80\\x9cdid he come at all?â\\x80\\x9d        She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.        â\\x80\\x9cHe could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,       when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come       hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing,       teasing, man! I will think no more about him.â\\x80\\x9d        Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the       approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look,       which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than       Elizabeth.        â\\x80\\x9cNow,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cthat this first meeting is over, I feel       perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be       embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on       Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we       meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, very indifferent indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, laughingly. â\\x80\\x9cOh,       Jane, take care.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger       now?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI think you are in very great danger of making him as much in       love with you as ever.â\\x80\\x9d        They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.       Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy       schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley,       in half an hourâ\\x80\\x99s visit, had revived.        On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and       the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their       punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they       repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see       whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former       parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother,       occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by       herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane       happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He       placed himself by her.        Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his       friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have       imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had       she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an       expression of half-laughing alarm.        His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as       showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than       formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,       Janeâ\\x80\\x99s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though       she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received       pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the       animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no       cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the       table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She       knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either,       or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to       hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they       spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner       whenever they did. Her motherâ\\x80\\x99s ungraciousness, made the sense of       what they owed him more painful to Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s mind; and she       would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him       that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of       the family.        She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity       of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not       pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of       conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his       entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the       drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull       to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to       their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure       for the evening must depend.        â\\x80\\x9cIf he does not come to me, _then_,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cI shall give him       up for ever.â\\x80\\x9d        The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have       answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the       table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring       out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a       single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the       gentlemenâ\\x80\\x99s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her       than ever, and said, in a whisper:        â\\x80\\x9cThe men shanâ\\x80\\x99t come and part us, I am determined. We want none       of them; do we?â\\x80\\x9d        Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed       him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely       patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged       against herself for being so silly!        â\\x80\\x9cA man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish       enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the       sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second       proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to       their feelings!â\\x80\\x9d        She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his       coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:        â\\x80\\x9cIs your sister at Pemberley still?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, she will remain there till Christmas.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd quite alone? Have all her friends left her?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to       Scarborough, these three weeks.â\\x80\\x9d        She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to       converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her,       however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young       ladyâ\\x80\\x99s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.        When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the       ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined       by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a       victim to her motherâ\\x80\\x99s rapacity for whist players, and in a few       moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost       every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening       at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his       eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to       make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.        Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to       supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of       the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.        â\\x80\\x9cWell girls,â\\x80\\x9d said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,       â\\x80\\x9cWhat say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off       uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as       any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turnâ\\x80\\x94and everybody       said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times       better than what we had at the Lucasesâ\\x80\\x99 last week; and even Mr.       Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well       done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.       And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs.       Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what       do you think she said besides? â\\x80\\x98Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have       her at Netherfield at last.â\\x80\\x99 She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long       is as good a creature as ever livedâ\\x80\\x94and her nieces are very       pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them       prodigiously.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen       enough of Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she       would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her       family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that       she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next       day, to make his proposals.        â\\x80\\x9cIt has been a very agreeable day,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bennet to       Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cThe party seemed so well selected, so suitable one       with the other. I hope we may often meet again.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth smiled.        â\\x80\\x9cLizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies       me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation       as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish       beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now       are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is       only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a       stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are very cruel,â\\x80\\x9d said her sister, â\\x80\\x9cyou will not let me       smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow hard it is in some cases to be believed!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd how impossible in others!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I       acknowledge?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all       love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth       knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not       make _me_ your confidante.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 55        A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.       His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to       return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and       was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine       with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed       himself engaged elsewhere.        â\\x80\\x9cNext time you call,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cI hope we shall be more lucky.â\\x80\\x9d        He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if       she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of       waiting on them.        â\\x80\\x9cCan you come to-morrow?â\\x80\\x9d        Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her       invitation was accepted with alacrity.        He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of       them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughterâ\\x80\\x99s room, in her       dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is comeâ\\x80\\x94Mr. Bingley       is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come       to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never       mind Miss Lizzyâ\\x80\\x99s hair.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe will be down as soon as we can,â\\x80\\x9d said Jane; â\\x80\\x9cbut I dare say       Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half       an hour ago.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be       quick! Where is your sash, my dear?â\\x80\\x9d        But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to       go down without one of her sisters.        The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in       the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was       his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two       obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking       and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time,       without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not       observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently       said, â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me       for? What am I to do?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.â\\x80\\x9d She then sat       still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious       occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, â\\x80\\x9cCome here,       my love, I want to speak to you,â\\x80\\x9d took her out of the room. Jane       instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at       such premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in       to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and       called out:        â\\x80\\x9cLizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was forced to go.        â\\x80\\x9cWe may as well leave them by themselves you know;â\\x80\\x9d said her       mother, as soon as she was in the hall. â\\x80\\x9cKitty and I are going up       stairs to sit in my dressing-room.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained       quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then       returned into the drawing-room.        Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was       every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her       daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable       addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged       officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with       a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to       the daughter.        He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he       went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and       Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with       her husband.        After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word       passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went       to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded,       unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,       however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have       taken place with that gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s concurrence.        Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet       spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was       much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was       nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his       ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more       communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen       him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the       evening Mrs. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s invention was again at work to get every       body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter       to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon       after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards,       she could not be wanted to counteract her motherâ\\x80\\x99s schemes.        But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was       finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to       fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening       the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together       over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had       this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily       turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it       all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought       was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and       Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who       as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering       a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.        Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence       would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,       with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in       the world.        â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis too much!â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cby far too much. I do not deserve       it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a       warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every       sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But       she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half       that remained to be said for the present.        â\\x80\\x9cI must go instantly to my mother;â\\x80\\x9d she cried. â\\x80\\x9cI would not on       any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her       to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father       already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give       such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much       happiness!â\\x80\\x9d        She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up       the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.        Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity       and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given       them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd this,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cis the end of all his friendâ\\x80\\x99s anxious       circumspection! of all his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s falsehood and contrivance!       the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!â\\x80\\x9d        In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with       her father had been short and to the purpose.        â\\x80\\x9cWhere is your sister?â\\x80\\x9d said he hastily, as he opened the door.        â\\x80\\x9cWith my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare       say.â\\x80\\x9d        He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good       wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily       expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They       shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came       down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own       happiness, and of Janeâ\\x80\\x99s perfections; and in spite of his being a       lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity       to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the       excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane,       and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and       himself.        It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the       satisfaction of Miss Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s mind gave a glow of such sweet       animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.       Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.       Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation       in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked       to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet       joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how       really happy he was.        Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till       their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was       gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:        â\\x80\\x9cJane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.â\\x80\\x9d        Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his       goodness.        â\\x80\\x9cYou are a good girl;â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cand I have great pleasure in       thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of       your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means       unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever       be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and       so generous, that you will always exceed your income.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters       would be unpardonable in _me_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cExceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,â\\x80\\x9d cried his wife, â\\x80\\x9cwhat       are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and       very likely more.â\\x80\\x9d Then addressing her daughter, â\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear,       dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shanâ\\x80\\x99t get a wink of sleep       all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so,       at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I       remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into       Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you       should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that       ever was seen!â\\x80\\x9d        Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition       her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her       younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects       of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.        Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and       Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.        Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at       Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always       remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous       neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an       invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.        Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her       sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow       on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both       of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.       In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth,       for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone,       Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.        â\\x80\\x9cHe has made me so happy,â\\x80\\x9d said she, one evening, â\\x80\\x9cby telling me       that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I       had not believed it possible.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI suspected as much,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cBut how did he account       for it?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt must have been his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s doing. They were certainly no       friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,       since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many       respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their       brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we       shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once       were to each other.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is the most unforgiving speech,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cthat I       ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see       you again the dupe of Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s pretended regard.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWould you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last       November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of       _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down       again!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHe made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of       his modesty.â\\x80\\x9d        This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his       diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good       qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed       the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most       generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a       circumstance which must prejudice her against him.        â\\x80\\x9cI am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!â\\x80\\x9d       cried Jane. â\\x80\\x9cOh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and       blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there       were but such another man for you!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy       as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can       have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and,       perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.       Collins in time.â\\x80\\x9d        The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be       long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.       Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the       same by all her neighbours in Meryton.        The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in       the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first       run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for       misfortune.     Chapter 56        One morning, about a week after Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s engagement with Jane       had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting       together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn       to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a       chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the       morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to       that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and       neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded       it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that       somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet       to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with       him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of       the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,       till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was       Lady Catherine de Bourgh.        They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their       astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of       Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them,       even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.        She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,       made no other reply to Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s salutation than a slight       inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.       Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s       entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.        Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of       such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.       After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to       Elizabeth,        â\\x80\\x9cI hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your       mother.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, madam,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady       Catherine. â\\x80\\x9cShe is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all       is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,       walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part       of the family.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou have a very small park here,â\\x80\\x9d returned Lady Catherine after       a short silence.        â\\x80\\x9cIt is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but       I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucasâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThis must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,       in summer; the windows are full west.â\\x80\\x9d        Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,       and then added:        â\\x80\\x9cMay I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left       Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, very well. I saw them the night before last.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her       from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her       calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.        Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take       some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not       very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,       said to Elizabeth,        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little       wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a       turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cGo, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, â\\x80\\x9cand show her ladyship about the       different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,       attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the       hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and       drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be       decent looking rooms, walked on.        Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her       waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the       gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to       make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more       than usually insolent and disagreeable.        â\\x80\\x9cHow could I ever think her like her nephew?â\\x80\\x9d said she, as she       looked in her face.        As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the       following manner:â\\x80\\x94        â\\x80\\x9cYou can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of       my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell       you why I come.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to       account for the honour of seeing you here.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet,â\\x80\\x9d replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, â\\x80\\x9cyou ought       to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere       _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character       has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in       a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from       it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I       was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most       advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet,       would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew,       my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous       falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose       the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for       this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf you believed it impossible to be true,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth,       colouring with astonishment and disdain, â\\x80\\x9cI wonder you took the       trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by       it?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAt once to insist upon having such a report universally       contradicted.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,â\\x80\\x9d said       Elizabeth coolly, â\\x80\\x9cwill be rather a confirmation of it; if,       indeed, such a report is in existence.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been       industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such       a report is spread abroad?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI never heard that it was.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for       it?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.       _You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThis is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being       satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour ladyship has declared it to be impossible.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of       his reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of       infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to       all his family. You may have drawn him in.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to       such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in       the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut you are not entitled to know _mine;_ nor will such behaviour       as this, ever induce me to be explicit.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLet me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the       presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy       is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose       he will make an offer to me.â\\x80\\x9d        Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:        â\\x80\\x9cThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their       infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the       favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in       their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when       the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their       marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of       no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do       you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit       engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of       propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his       earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there       is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall       certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt       wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you       could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on       others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination       confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And       if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBecause honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.       Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by       his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the       inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and       despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a       disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThese are heavy misfortunes,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cBut the wife       of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness       necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the       whole, have no cause to repine.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cObstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your       gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to       me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss       Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of       carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not       been used to submit to any personâ\\x80\\x99s whims. I have not been in the       habit of brooking disappointment.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9c_That_ will make your ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s situation at present more       pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and       my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the       maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the fatherâ\\x80\\x99s,       from respectable, honourable, and ancientâ\\x80\\x94though       untitledâ\\x80\\x94families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They       are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their       respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart       pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or       fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If       you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit       the sphere in which you have been brought up.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIn marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as       quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s       daughter; so far we are equal.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTrue. You _are_ a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s daughter. But who was your mother?       Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of       their condition.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhatever my connections may be,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cif your nephew       does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cTell me once for all, are you engaged to him?â\\x80\\x9d        Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady       Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say,       after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s deliberation:        â\\x80\\x9cI am not.â\\x80\\x9d        Lady Catherine seemed pleased.        â\\x80\\x9cAnd will you promise me, never to enter into such an       engagement?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI will make no promise of the kind.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a       more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a       belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have       given me the assurance I require.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be       intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship       wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you       the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more       probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing       to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?       Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which       you have supported this extraordinary application have been as       frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely       mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such       persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your       interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have       certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,       therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNot so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the       objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I       am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisterâ\\x80\\x99s       infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young manâ\\x80\\x99s marrying       her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and       uncles. And is _such_ a girl to be my nephewâ\\x80\\x99s sister? Is _her_       husband, who is the son of his late fatherâ\\x80\\x99s steward, to be his       brother? Heaven and earth!â\\x80\\x94of what are you thinking? Are the       shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou can _now_ have nothing further to say,â\\x80\\x9d she resentfully       answered. â\\x80\\x9cYou have insulted me in every possible method. I must       beg to return to the house.â\\x80\\x9d        And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they       turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.        â\\x80\\x9cYou have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my       nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a       connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my       sentiments.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou are then resolved to have him?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that       manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,       without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly       unconnected with me.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey       the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to       ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the       contempt of the world.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNeither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth,       â\\x80\\x9chave any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No       principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr.       Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the       indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his       marrying me, it would not give me one momentâ\\x80\\x99s concernâ\\x80\\x94and the       world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very       well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet,       that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I       hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry       my point.â\\x80\\x9d        In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the       door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, â\\x80\\x9cI       take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your       mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously       displeased.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her       ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it       herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up       stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the       dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again       and rest herself.        â\\x80\\x9cShe did not choose it,â\\x80\\x9d said her daughter, â\\x80\\x9cshe would go.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShe is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was       prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the       Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say,       and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call       on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you,       Lizzy?â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to       acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.     Chapter 57        The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw       Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for       many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady       Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this       journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her       supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to       be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could       originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she       recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and       _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the       expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to       supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the       marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.       And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their       communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had       reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost       certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as       possible at some future time.        In revolving Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s expressions, however, she could not       help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of       her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of       her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to       Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;       and how he might take a similar representation of the evils       attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She       knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his       dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he       thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it       was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with       _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own,       his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions       of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to       Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good       sense and solid reasoning.        If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had       often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a       relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to       be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case       he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way       through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to       Netherfield must give way.        â\\x80\\x9cIf, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come       to his friend within a few days,â\\x80\\x9d she added, â\\x80\\x9cI shall know how to       understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every       wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting       me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall       soon cease to regret him at all.â\\x80\\x9d        The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their       visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied       it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.       Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on       the subject.        The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her       father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.        â\\x80\\x9cLizzy,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI was going to look for you; come into my       room.â\\x80\\x9d        She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had       to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in       some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck       her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated       with dismay all the consequent explanations.        She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat       down. He then said,        â\\x80\\x9cI have received a letter this morning that has astonished me       exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to       know its contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_       daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a       very important conquest.â\\x80\\x9d        The colour now rushed into Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s cheeks in the       instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,       instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be       pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his       letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father       continued:        â\\x80\\x9cYou look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such       matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to       discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr.       Collins.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cFrom Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cSomething very much to the purpose of course. He begins with       congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest       daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the       good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your       impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates       to yourself, is as follows: â\\x80\\x98Having thus offered you the sincere       congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event,       let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which       we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter       Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet,       after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of       her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most       illustrious personages in this land.â\\x80\\x99        â\\x80\\x9cCan you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? â\\x80\\x98This young       gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the       heart of mortal can most desire,â\\x80\\x94splendid property, noble       kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these       temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of       what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this       gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to       take immediate advantage of.â\\x80\\x99        â\\x80\\x9cHave you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it       comes out:        â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to       imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on       the match with a friendly eye.â\\x80\\x99        â\\x80\\x9c_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_       surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man       within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have       given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy,       who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who       probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth tried to join in her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s pleasantry, but could       only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been       directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.        â\\x80\\x9cAre you not diverted?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! yes. Pray read on.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her       ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual       condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it       became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on       the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what       she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give       the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her       noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run       hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.â\\x80\\x99       Mr. Collins moreover adds, â\\x80\\x98I am truly rejoiced that my cousin       Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only       concerned that their living together before the marriage took       place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect       the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement       at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as       soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and       had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously       have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a       Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their       names to be mentioned in your hearing.â\\x80\\x99 _That_ is his notion of       Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his       dear Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s situation, and his expectation of a young       olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.       You are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be       affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make       sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cI am excessively diverted. But it is so       strange!â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other       man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference,       and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much       as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s       correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter       of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over       Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my       son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this       report? Did she call to refuse her consent?â\\x80\\x9d        To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as       it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not       distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at       a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was       necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father       had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s       indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want       of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too       _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.     Chapter 58        Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,       as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to       bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed       after Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and,       before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his       aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who       wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It       was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary       could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.       Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip       them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were       to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty       was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly       forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the       same.        They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call       upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a       general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him       alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and,       while her courage was high, she immediately said:        â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of       giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be       wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your       unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known       it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully       I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not       have merely my own gratitude to express.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am sorry, exceedingly sorry,â\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, in a tone of       surprise and emotion, â\\x80\\x9cthat you have ever been informed of what       may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not       think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou must not blame my aunt. Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s thoughtlessness first       betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of       course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me       thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that       generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble,       and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering       them.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIf you _will_ thank me,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9clet it be for yourself       alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force       to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to       deny. But your _family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I       believe I thought only of _you_.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short       pause, her companion added, â\\x80\\x9cYou are too generous to trifle with       me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me       so at once. _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one       word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and       anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and       immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand       that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the       period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude       and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this       reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before;       and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as       warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had       Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how       well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face,       became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and       he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she       was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.        They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too       much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any       other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their       present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_       call on him in her return through London, and there relate her       journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her       conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every       expression of the latter which, in her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s apprehension,       peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief       that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that       promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But,       unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly       contrariwise.        â\\x80\\x9cIt taught me to hope,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cas I had scarcely ever allowed       myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be       certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided       against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine,       frankly and openly.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, â\\x80\\x9cYes, you know       enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After       abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple       in abusing you to all your relations.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your       accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my       behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It       was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWe will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to       that evening,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cThe conduct of neither, if       strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we       have both, I hope, improved in civility.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of       what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions       during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,       inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I       shall never forget: â\\x80\\x98had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike       manner.â\\x80\\x99 Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely       conceive, how they have tortured me;â\\x80\\x94though it was some time, I       confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong       an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever       felt in such a way.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every       proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I       shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed       you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not       do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily       ashamed of it.â\\x80\\x9d        Darcy mentioned his letter. â\\x80\\x9cDid it,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cdid it soon make       you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit       to its contents?â\\x80\\x9d        She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually       all her former prejudices had been removed.        â\\x80\\x9cI knew,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat what I wrote must give you pain, but it       was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was       one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your       having the power of reading again. I can remember some       expressions which might justly make you hate me.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThe letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential       to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason       to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I       hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhen I wrote that letter,â\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cI believed myself       perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was       written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThe letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.       The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The       feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it,       are now so widely different from what they were then, that every       unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You       must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its       remembrance gives you pleasure.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_       retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the       contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is       much better, of innocence. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful       recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be       repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,       though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was       _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given       good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.       Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), I was       spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,       particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed,       encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to       care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all       the rest of the world; to _wish_ at least to think meanly of       their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from       eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but       for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You       taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.       By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of       my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my       pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHad you then persuaded yourself that I should?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIndeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you       to be wishing, expecting my addresses.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I       assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might       often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_       evening?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began       to take a proper direction.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met       at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNo indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYour surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed       by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary       politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_       than my due.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy object _then_,â\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, â\\x80\\x9cwas to show you, by every       civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the       past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill       opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended       to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly       tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.â\\x80\\x9d        He then told her of Georgianaâ\\x80\\x99s delight in her acquaintance, and       of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally       leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that       his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her       sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his       gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other       struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.        She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a       subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.        After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy       to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their       watches, that it was time to be at home.        â\\x80\\x9cWhat could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!â\\x80\\x9d was a wonder which       introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted       with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest       information of it.        â\\x80\\x9cI must ask whether you were surprised?â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth.        â\\x80\\x9cNot at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThat is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as       much.â\\x80\\x9d And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had       been pretty much the case.        â\\x80\\x9cOn the evening before my going to London,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI made a       confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.       I told him of all that had occurred to make my former       interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise       was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him,       moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had       done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could       easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt       no doubt of their happiness together.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing       his friend.        â\\x80\\x9cDid you speak from your own observation,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cwhen you       told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information       last spring?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cFrom the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two       visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her       affection.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate       conviction to him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had       prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case,       but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to       confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended       him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had       been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and       purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am       persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your       sisterâ\\x80\\x99s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most       delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was       invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had       yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to       begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course       was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation       till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.     Chapter 59        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?â\\x80\\x9d was a       question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she       entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to       table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered       about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she       spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion       of the truth.        The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.       The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged       were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness       overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather       _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for,       besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils       before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when       her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him       but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_       which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.        At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very       far from Miss Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s general habits, she was absolutely       incredulous here.        â\\x80\\x9cYou are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!â\\x80\\x94engaged to Mr. Darcy! No,       no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThis is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on       you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.       Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He       still loves me, and we are engaged.â\\x80\\x9d        Jane looked at her doubtingly. â\\x80\\x9cOh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know       how much you dislike him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot.       Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in       such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the       last time I shall ever remember it myself.â\\x80\\x9d        Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more       seriously assured her of its truth.        â\\x80\\x9cGood Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,â\\x80\\x9d       cried Jane. â\\x80\\x9cMy dear, dear Lizzy, I wouldâ\\x80\\x94I do congratulate       youâ\\x80\\x94but are you certain? forgive the questionâ\\x80\\x94are you quite       certain that you can be happy with him?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cThere can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already,       that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you       pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cVery, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself       more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as       impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh,       Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you       quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do,       when I tell you all.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWhy, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I       am afraid you will be angry.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very       seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without       delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it       began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his       beautiful grounds at Pemberley.â\\x80\\x9d        Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the       desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn       assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss       Bennet had nothing further to wish.        â\\x80\\x9cNow I am quite happy,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cfor you will be as happy as       myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his       love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as       Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and       yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very       reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at       Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,       not to you.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been       unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own       feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But       now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s       marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in       conversation.        â\\x80\\x9cGood gracious!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the       next morning, â\\x80\\x9cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here       again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so       tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he       would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us       with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk       out with him again, that he may not be in Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s way.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;       yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him       such an epithet.        As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,       and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good       information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Bennet,       have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way       again to-day?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, â\\x80\\x9cto       walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and       Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cIt may do very well for the others,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Bingley; â\\x80\\x9cbut I       am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wonâ\\x80\\x99t it, Kitty?â\\x80\\x9d Kitty       owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great       curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently       consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet       followed her, saying:        â\\x80\\x9cI am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that       disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind       it: it is all for Janeâ\\x80\\x99s sake, you know; and there is no occasion       for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put       yourself to inconvenience.â\\x80\\x9d        During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s consent       should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved       to herself the application for her motherâ\\x80\\x99s. She could not       determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting       whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome       her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set       against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain       that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her       sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the       first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her       disapprobation.        In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,       she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on       seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s opposition,       but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be       through her meansâ\\x80\\x94that _she_, his favourite child, should be       distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears       and regrets in disposing of herâ\\x80\\x94was a wretched reflection, and       she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at       him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he       approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while       pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, â\\x80\\x9cGo to your       father, he wants you in the library.â\\x80\\x9d She was gone directly.        Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.       â\\x80\\x9cLizzy,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cwhat are you doing? Are you out of your       senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?â\\x80\\x9d        How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been       more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have       spared her from explanations and professions which it was       exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she       assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.        â\\x80\\x9cOr, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich,       to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages       than Jane. But will they make you happy?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHave you any other objection,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cthan your belief       of my indifference?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cNone at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of       man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI do, I do like him,â\\x80\\x9d she replied, with tears in her eyes, â\\x80\\x9cI       love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly       amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain       me by speaking of him in such terms.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLizzy,â\\x80\\x9d said her father, â\\x80\\x9cI have given him my consent. He is the       kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,       which he condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are       resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of       it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be       neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your       husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively       talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal       marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My       child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to       respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her       reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was       really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change       which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute       certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had       stood the test of many monthsâ\\x80\\x99 suspense, and enumerating with       energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s       incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.        â\\x80\\x9cWell, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d said he, when she ceased speaking, â\\x80\\x9cI have no       more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not       have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.â\\x80\\x9d        To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.       Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with       astonishment.        â\\x80\\x9cThis is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every       thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellowâ\\x80\\x99s       debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will       save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncleâ\\x80\\x99s       doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young       lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him       to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and       there will be an end of the matter.â\\x80\\x9d        He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his       reading Mr. Collinsâ\\x80\\x99s letter; and after laughing at her some       time, allowed her at last to goâ\\x80\\x94saying, as she quitted the room,       â\\x80\\x9cIf any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am       quite at leisure.â\\x80\\x9d        Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,       after half an hourâ\\x80\\x99s quiet reflection in her own room, she was       able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was       too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away;       there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the       comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.        When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she       followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect       was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat       quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under       many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard;       though not in general backward to credit what was for the       advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to       any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in       her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.        â\\x80\\x9cGood gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!       Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest       Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what       jewels, what carriages you will have! Janeâ\\x80\\x99s is nothing to       itâ\\x80\\x94nothing at all. I am so pleasedâ\\x80\\x94so happy. Such a charming       man!â\\x80\\x94so handsome! so tall!â\\x80\\x94Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for       my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook       it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is       charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!       What will become of me. I shall go distracted.â\\x80\\x9d        This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be       doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard       only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three       minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.        â\\x80\\x9cMy dearest child,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, â\\x80\\x9cI can think of nothing else! Ten       thousand a year, and very likely more! â\\x80\\x99Tis as good as a Lord!       And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special       licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is       particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d        This was a sad omen of what her motherâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour to the       gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in       the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of       her relationsâ\\x80\\x99 consent, there was still something to be wished       for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for       Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law       that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power       to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his       opinion.        Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains       to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that       he was rising every hour in his esteem.        â\\x80\\x9cI admire all my three sons-in-law highly,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cWickham,       perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband       quite as well as Janeâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 60        Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted       Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.       â\\x80\\x9cHow could you begin?â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cI can comprehend your going on       charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could       set you off in the first place?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the       words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in       the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy beauty you had early withstood, and as for my mannersâ\\x80\\x94my       behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil,       and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain       than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cFor the liveliness of your mind, I did.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little       less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference,       of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who       were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_       approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so       unlike _them_. Had you not been really amiable, you would have       hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise       yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your       heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously       courted you. Thereâ\\x80\\x94I have saved you the trouble of accounting for       it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it       perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of       meâ\\x80\\x94but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cWas there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while       she was ill at Netherfield?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cDearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a       virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your       protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;       and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing       and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin       directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the       point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called,       and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did       you look as if you did not care about me?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBecause you were grave and silent, and gave me no       encouragement.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cBut I was embarrassed.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd so was I.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cA man who had felt less, might.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cHow unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,       and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder       how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to       yourself. I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not       asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to       Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too much_, I am afraid; for       what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach       of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This       will never do.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cYou need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly       fair. Lady Catherineâ\\x80\\x99s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us       were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for       my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your       gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of       yours. My auntâ\\x80\\x99s intelligence had given me hope, and I was       determined at once to know every thing.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her       happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come       down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and       be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious       consequence?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cMy real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could,       whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or       what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were       still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession       to him which I have since made.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cShall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what       is to befall her?â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cI am more likely to want  time than courage, Elizabeth. But it       ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it       shall be done directly.â\\x80\\x9d        â\\x80\\x9cAnd if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you       and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady       once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer       neglected.â\\x80\\x9d        From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.       Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.       Gardinerâ\\x80\\x99s long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate       which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to       find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of       happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:        â\\x80\\x9cI would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to       have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of       particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You       supposed more than really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as       you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your       imagination in every possible flight which the subject will       afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot       greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a       great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and       again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to       wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round       the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world.       Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such       justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.       Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare       from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours,       etc.â\\x80\\x9d        Mr. Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;       and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr.       Collins, in reply to his last.        â\\x80\\x9cDear Sir,       â\\x80\\x9cI must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will       soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as       you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has       more to give.        â\\x80\\x9cYours sincerely, etc.â\\x80\\x9d        Miss Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching       marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote       even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat       all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but       she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could       not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was       deserved.        The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar       information, was as sincere as her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s in sending it. Four       sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and       all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.        Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any       congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family       heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The       reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine       had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her       nephewâ\\x80\\x99s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match,       was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a       moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to       Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must       sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.       Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her       husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could       even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on       carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed       his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s, with       very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not       till Sir William was out of sight.        Mrs. Phillipsâ\\x80\\x99s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax       on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her       sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the       familiarity which Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever       she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him,       though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more       elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the       frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to       herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse       without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings       arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of       its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked       forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from       society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and       elegance of their family party at Pemberley.     Chapter 61        Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.       Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what       delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked       of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake       of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in       the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an       effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman       for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her       husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so       unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and       invariably silly.        Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection       for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.       He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least       expected.        Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.       So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not       desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.       The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an       estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and       Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were       within thirty miles of each other.        Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her       time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what       she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not       of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the       influence of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s example, she became, by proper attention and       management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From       the further disadvantage of Lydiaâ\\x80\\x99s society she was of course       carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to       come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men,       her father would never consent to her going.        Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was       necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.       Bennetâ\\x80\\x99s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix       more with the world, but she could still moralize over every       morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons       between her sistersâ\\x80\\x99 beauty and her own, it was suspected by her       father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.        As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution       from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the       conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with       whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown       to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope       that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The       congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her       marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by       himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this       effect:        â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lizzy,       â\\x80\\x9cI wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my       dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to       have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope       you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at       court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money       enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of       about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to       Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.        â\\x80\\x9cYours, etc.â\\x80\\x9d        As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she       endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and       expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her       power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy       in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had       always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under       the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and       heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their       support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or       herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance       towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even       when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was       unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to       place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more       than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into       indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her       youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation       which her marriage had given her.        Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for       Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s sake, he assisted him further in his profession.       Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone       to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they       both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingleyâ\\x80\\x99s good       humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of       giving them a hint to be gone.        Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcyâ\\x80\\x99s marriage; but       as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at       Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of       Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid       off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.        Pemberley was now Georgianaâ\\x80\\x99s home; and the attachment of the       sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able       to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had       the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first       she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her       lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had       always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her       affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind       received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By       Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman       may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not       always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than       himself.        Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her       nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her       character in her reply to the letter which announced its       arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of       Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But       at length, by Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s persuasion, he was prevailed on to       overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a       little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment       gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to       see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait       on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods       had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress,       but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.        With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.       Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were       both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons       who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of       uniting them.     *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org  Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Title: A Christmas Carol        A Ghost Story of Christmas  Author: Charles Dickens  Release Date: 1992 [eBook #46] [Most recently updated: March 4, 2018]  Language: English  Character set encoding: UTF-8  Produced by: Jose Menendez and David Widger  *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A CHRISTMAS CAROL ***     A CHRISTMAS CAROL  IN PROSE BEING A Ghost Story of Christmas  by Charles Dickens    PREFACE  I HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me.  May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.  Their faithful Friend and Servant,                                    C. D. December, 1843.    CONTENTS  Stave   I: Marley\\'s Ghost Stave  II: The First of the Three Spirits Stave III: The Second of the Three Spirits Stave  IV: The Last of the Spirits Stave   V: The End of It    STAVE I:  MARLEY\\'S GHOST  MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge\\'s name was good upon \\'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.  Mind! I don\\'t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country\\'s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.  Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don\\'t know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.  The mention of Marley\\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\\'s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot--say Saint Paul\\'s Churchyard for instance-- literally to astonish his son\\'s weak mind.  Scrooge never painted out Old Marley\\'s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.  Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn\\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.  External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\\'t know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\" handsomely, and Scrooge never did.  Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o\\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\\'s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, \"No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"  But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.  Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already-- it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.  The door of Scrooge\\'s counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\\'s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\\'t replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.  \"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge\\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.  \"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\"  He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge\\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.  \"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"You don\\'t mean that, I am sure?\"  \"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You\\'re poor enough.\"  \"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\\'re rich enough.\"  Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up with \"Humbug.\"  \"Don\\'t be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.  \"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\\'s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in \\'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot who goes about with \\'Merry Christmas\\' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"  \"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.  \"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"  \"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"But you don\\'t keep it.\"  \"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you!\"  \"There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,\" returned the nephew. \"Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!\"  The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.  \"Let me hear another sound from you,\" said Scrooge, \"and you\\'ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You\\'re quite a powerful speaker, sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you don\\'t go into Parliament.\"  \"Don\\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\"  Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.  \"But why?\" cried Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"Why?\"  \"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.  \"Because I fell in love.\"  \"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \"Good afternoon!\"  \"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?\"  \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.  \"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?\"  \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.  \"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I\\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!\"  \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.  \"And A Happy New Year!\"  \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.  His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.  \"There\\'s another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas. I\\'ll retire to Bedlam.\"  This lunatic, in letting Scrooge\\'s nephew out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge\\'s office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.  \"Scrooge and Marley\\'s, I believe,\" said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. \"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\"  \"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\" Scrooge replied. \"He died seven years ago, this very night.\"  \"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.  It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word \"liberality,\" Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.  \"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\" said the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\"  \"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.  \"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.  \"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge. \"Are they still in operation?\"  \"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish I could say they were not.\"  \"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\" said Scrooge.  \"Both very busy, sir.\"  \"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I\\'m very glad to hear it.\"  \"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,\" returned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?\"  \"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.  \"You wish to be anonymous?\"  \"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don\\'t make merry myself at Christmas and I can\\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there.\"  \"Many can\\'t go there; and many would rather die.\"  \"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\\'t know that.\"  \"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.  \"It\\'s not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It\\'s enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\\'s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"  Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.  Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers\\' and grocers\\' trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\\'s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow\\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.  Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\\'s nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge\\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of          \"God bless you, merry gentleman!          May nothing you dismay!\"  Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.  At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.  \"You\\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said Scrooge.  \"If quite convenient, sir.\"  \"It\\'s not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it\\'s not fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you\\'d think yourself ill-used, I\\'ll be bound?\"  The clerk smiled faintly.  \"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don\\'t think me ill-used, when I pay a day\\'s wages for no work.\"  The clerk observed that it was only once a year.  \"A poor excuse for picking a man\\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. \"But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning.\"  The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman\\'s-buff.  Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker\\'s-book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.  Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including--which is a bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years\\' dead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but Marley\\'s face.  Marley\\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.  As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.  To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.  He did pause, with a moment\\'s irresolution, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley\\'s pigtail sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed it with a bang.  The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant\\'s cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.  You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn\\'t have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\\'s dip.  Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.  Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.  Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.  It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh\\'s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet\\'s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley\\'s head on every one.  \"Humbug!\" said Scrooge; and walked across the room.  After several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.  This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant\\'s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.  The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.  \"It\\'s humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won\\'t believe it.\"  His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know him; Marley\\'s Ghost!\" and fell again.  The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.  Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.  No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.  \"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. \"What do you want with me?\"  \"Much!\"--Marley\\'s voice, no doubt about it.  \"Who are you?\"  \"Ask me who I was.\"  \"Who were you then?\" said Scrooge, raising his voice. \"You\\'re particular, for a shade.\" He was going to say \"to a shade,\" but substituted this, as more appropriate.  \"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"  \"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.  \"I can.\"  \"Do it, then.\"  Scrooge asked the question, because he didn\\'t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.  \"You don\\'t believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.  \"I don\\'t,\" said Scrooge.  \"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?\"  \"I don\\'t know,\" said Scrooge.  \"Why do you doubt your senses?\"  \"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There\\'s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\"  Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre\\'s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.  To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something very awful, too, in the spectre\\'s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.  \"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision\\'s stony gaze from himself.  \"I do,\" replied the Ghost.  \"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.  \"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"  \"Well!\" returned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!\"  At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!  Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.  \"Mercy!\" he said. \"Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?\"  \"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do you believe in me or not?\"  \"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?\"  \"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned, \"that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is me!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!\"  Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.  \"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell me why?\"  \"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost. \"I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?\"  Scrooge trembled more and more.  \"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!\"  Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.  \"Jacob,\" he said, imploringly. \"Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!\"  \"I have none to give,\" the Ghost replied. \"It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!\"  It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.  \"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\" Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.  \"Slow!\" the Ghost repeated.  \"Seven years dead,\" mused Scrooge. \"And travelling all the time!\"  \"The whole time,\" said the Ghost. \"No rest, no peace. Incessant torture of remorse.\"  \"You travel fast?\" said Scrooge.  \"On the wings of the wind,\" replied the Ghost.  \"You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,\" said Scrooge.  The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.  \"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,\" cried the phantom, \"not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life\\'s opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!\"  \"But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,\" faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.  \"Business!\" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. \"Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!\"  It held up its chain at arm\\'s length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.  \"At this time of the rolling year,\" the spectre said, \"I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!\"  Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.  \"Hear me!\" cried the Ghost. \"My time is nearly gone.\"  \"I will,\" said Scrooge. \"But don\\'t be hard upon me! Don\\'t be flowery, Jacob! Pray!\"  \"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.\"  It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.  \"That is no light part of my penance,\" pursued the Ghost. \"I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\"  \"You were always a good friend to me,\" said Scrooge. \"Thank\\'ee!\"  \"You will be haunted,\" resumed the Ghost, \"by Three Spirits.\"  Scrooge\\'s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost\\'s had done.  \"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?\" he demanded, in a faltering voice.  \"It is.\"  \"I--I think I\\'d rather not,\" said Scrooge.  \"Without their visits,\" said the Ghost, \"you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.\"  \"Couldn\\'t I take \\'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?\" hinted Scrooge.  \"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!\"  When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.  The apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.  It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other, Marley\\'s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.  Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.  Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.  The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley\\'s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.  Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.  Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\" but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.   STAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS  WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.  To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!  He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.  \"Why, it isn\\'t possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn\\'t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!\"  The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world.  This was a great relief, because \"three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,\" and so forth, would have become a mere United States\\' security if there were no days to count by.  Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.  Marley\\'s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, \"Was it a dream or not?\"  Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.  The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.  \"Ding, dong!\"  \"A quarter past,\" said Scrooge, counting.  \"Ding, dong!\"  \"Half-past!\" said Scrooge.  \"Ding, dong!\"  \"A quarter to it,\" said Scrooge.  \"Ding, dong!\"  \"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge, triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"  He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.  Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.  The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.  It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child\\'s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.  Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.  \"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\" asked Scrooge.  \"I am!\"  The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.  \"Who, and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.  \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"  \"Long Past?\" inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish stature.  \"No. Your past.\"  Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.  \"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out, with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow!\"  Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.  \"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.  Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:  \"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"  It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm.  \"Rise! and walk with me!\"  It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman\\'s hand, was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.  \"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"  \"Bear but a touch of my hand there,\" said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more than this!\"  As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground.  \"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him. \"I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!\"  The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man\\'s sense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten!  \"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is that upon your cheek?\"  Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.  \"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.  \"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"  \"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed the Ghost. \"Let us go on.\"  They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it!  \"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said the Ghost. \"They have no consciousness of us.\"  The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?  \"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"  Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.  They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.  They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.  Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.  The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.  \"Why, it\\'s Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It\\'s dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what\\'s his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don\\'t you see him! And the Sultan\\'s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I\\'m glad of it. What business had he to be married to the Princess!\"  To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.  \"There\\'s the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island. \\'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?\\'  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn\\'t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"  Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor boy!\" and cried again.  \"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: \"but it\\'s too late now.\"  \"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.  \"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that\\'s all.\"  The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, \"Let us see another Christmas!\"  Scrooge\\'s former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.  He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.  It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her \"Dear, dear brother.\"  \"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. \"To bring you home, home, home!\"  \"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.  \"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home, for good and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home\\'s like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And you\\'re to be a man!\" said the child, opening her eyes, \"and are never to come back here; but first, we\\'re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.\"  \"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.  She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.  A terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master Scrooge\\'s box, there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of \"something\" to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not. Master Scrooge\\'s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.  \"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,\" said the Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"  \"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You\\'re right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!\"  \"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think, children.\"  \"One child,\" Scrooge returned.  \"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"  Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, \"Yes.\"  Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.  The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.  \"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here!\"  They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:  \"Why, it\\'s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it\\'s Fezziwig alive again!\"  Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:  \"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"  Scrooge\\'s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-\\'prentice.  \"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost. \"Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!\"  \"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night. Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let\\'s have the shutters up,\" cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack Robinson!\"  You wouldn\\'t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the street with the shutters--one, two, three--had \\'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred \\'em and pinned \\'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.  \"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads, and let\\'s have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!\"  Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn\\'t have cleared away, or couldn\\'t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter\\'s night.  In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother\\'s particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well done!\" and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.  There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\"  Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.  But if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that\\'s not high praise, tell me higher, and I\\'ll use it. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig\\'s calves. They shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn\\'t have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.  When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two \\'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop.  During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.  \"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.\"  \"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.  The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so, said,  \"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?\"  \"It isn\\'t that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. \"It isn\\'t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count \\'em up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"  He felt the Spirit\\'s glance, and stopped.  \"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.  \"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.  \"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.  \"No,\" said Scrooge, \"No. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now. That\\'s all.\"  His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.  \"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"  This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.  He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.  \"It matters little,\" she said, softly. \"To you, very little. Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.\"  \"What Idol has displaced you?\" he rejoined.  \"A golden one.\"  \"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\" he said. \"There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!\"  \"You fear the world too much,\" she answered, gently. \"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\"  \"What then?\" he retorted. \"Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you.\"  She shook her head.  \"Am I?\"  \"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When it was made, you were another man.\"  \"I was a boy,\" he said impatiently.  \"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,\" she returned. \"I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.\"  \"Have I ever sought release?\"  \"In words. No. Never.\"  \"In what, then?\"  \"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,\" said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; \"tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!\"  He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, \"You think not.\"  \"I would gladly think otherwise if I could,\" she answered, \"Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you once were.\"  He was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.  \"You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!\"  She left him, and they parted.  \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, \"show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you delight to torture me?\"  \"One shadow more!\" exclaimed the Ghost.  \"No more!\" cried Scrooge. \"No more. I don\\'t wish to see it. Show me no more!\"  But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next.  They were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn\\'t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn\\'t have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn\\'t have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.  But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll\\'s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.  And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.  \"Belle,\" said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, \"I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.\"  \"Who was it?\"  \"Guess!\"  \"How can I? Tut, don\\'t I know?\" she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed. \"Mr. Scrooge.\"  \"Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.\"  \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge in a broken voice, \"remove me from this place.\"  \"I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,\" said the Ghost. \"That they are what they are, do not blame me!\"  \"Remove me!\" Scrooge exclaimed, \"I cannot bear it!\"  He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.  \"Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!\"  In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.  The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.  He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom.  He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.   STAVE III:  THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS  AWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley\\'s intervention. But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.  Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don\\'t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.  Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door.  The moment Scrooge\\'s hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.  It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge\\'s time, or Marley\\'s, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty\\'s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.  \"Come in!\" exclaimed the Ghost. \"Come in! and know me better, man!\"  Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit\\'s eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.  \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,\" said the Spirit. \"Look upon me!\"  Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.  \"You have never seen the like of me before!\" exclaimed the Spirit.  \"Never,\" Scrooge made answer to it.  \"Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?\" pursued the Phantom.  \"I don\\'t think I have,\" said Scrooge. \"I am afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?\"  \"More than eighteen hundred,\" said the Ghost.  \"A tremendous family to provide for!\" muttered Scrooge.  The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.  \"Spirit,\" said Scrooge submissively, \"conduct me where you will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.\"  \"Touch my robe!\"  Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.  Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms.  The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away to their dear hearts\\' content. There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.  For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest-- laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers\\' shops were still half open, and the fruiterers\\' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers\\' benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people\\'s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.  The Grocers\\'! oh, the Grocers\\'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.  But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers\\' shops. The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker\\'s doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!  In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker\\'s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.  \"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?\" asked Scrooge.  \"There is. My own.\"  \"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\" asked Scrooge.  \"To any kindly given. To a poor one most.\"  \"Why to a poor one most?\" asked Scrooge.  \"Because it needs it most.\"  \"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, after a moment\\'s thought, \"I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people\\'s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.\"  \"I!\" cried the Spirit.  \"You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,\" said Scrooge. \"Wouldn\\'t you?\"  \"I!\" cried the Spirit.  \"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?\" said Scrooge. \"And it comes to the same thing.\"  \"I seek!\" exclaimed the Spirit.  \"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,\" said Scrooge.  \"There are some upon this earth of yours,\" returned the Spirit, \"who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.\"  Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker\\'s), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.  And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge\\'s clerk\\'s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit\\'s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen \"Bob\" a-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!  Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit\\'s wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob\\'s private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker\\'s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.  \"What has ever got your precious father then?\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn\\'t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?\"  \"Here\\'s Martha, mother!\" said a girl, appearing as she spoke.  \"Here\\'s Martha, mother!\" cried the two young Cratchits. \"Hurrah! There\\'s such a goose, Martha!\"  \"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!\" said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.  \"We\\'d a deal of work to finish up last night,\" replied the girl, \"and had to clear away this morning, mother!\"  \"Well! Never mind so long as you are come,\" said Mrs. Cratchit. \"Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!\"  \"No, no! There\\'s father coming,\" cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. \"Hide, Martha, hide!\"  So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!  \"Why, where\\'s our Martha?\" cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.  \"Not coming,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.  \"Not coming!\" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim\\'s blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant. \"Not coming upon Christmas Day!\"  Martha didn\\'t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.  \"And how did little Tim behave?\" asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart\\'s content.  \"As good as gold,\" said Bob, \"and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.\"  Bob\\'s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.  His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.  Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!  There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn\\'t believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn\\'t ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.  Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed.  Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook\\'s next door to each other, with a laundress\\'s next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.  Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.  At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit\\'s elbow stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.  These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:  \"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!\"  Which all the family re-echoed.  \"God bless us every one!\" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.  He sat very close to his father\\'s side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.  \"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, \"tell me if Tiny Tim will live.\"  \"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.\"  \"No, no,\" said Scrooge. \"Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.\"  \"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race,\" returned the Ghost, \"will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\"  Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.  \"Man,\" said the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man\\'s child. Oh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!\"  Scrooge bent before the Ghost\\'s rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name.  \"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob; \"I\\'ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast!\"  \"The Founder of the Feast indeed!\" cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. \"I wish I had him here. I\\'d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he\\'d have a good appetite for it.\"  \"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children! Christmas Day.\"  \"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,\" said she, \"on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!\"  \"My dear,\" was Bob\\'s mild answer, \"Christmas Day.\"  \"I\\'ll drink his health for your sake and the Day\\'s,\" said Mrs. Cratchit, \"not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy new year! He\\'ll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!\"  The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn\\'t care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.  After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter\\'s being a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner\\'s, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord \"was much about as tall as Peter;\" at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn\\'t have seen his head if you had been there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.  There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker\\'s. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit\\'s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.  By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour\\'s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!  But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas!  And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.  \"What place is this?\" asked Scrooge.  \"A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,\" returned the Spirit. \"But they know me. See!\"  A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children\\'s children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a boy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.  The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Scrooge\\'s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.  Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds --born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.  But even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.  Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea --on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.  It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew\\'s and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!  \"Ha, ha!\" laughed Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"Ha, ha, ha!\"  If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge\\'s nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I\\'ll cultivate his acquaintance.  It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge\\'s nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge\\'s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.  \"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!\"  \"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\" cried Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"He believed it too!\"  \"More shame for him, Fred!\" said Scrooge\\'s niece, indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest.  She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature\\'s head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.  \"He\\'s a comical old fellow,\" said Scrooge\\'s nephew, \"that\\'s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.\"  \"I\\'m sure he is very rich, Fred,\" hinted Scrooge\\'s niece. \"At least you always tell me so.\"  \"What of that, my dear!\" said Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"His wealth is of no use to him. He don\\'t do any good with it. He don\\'t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn\\'t the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is ever going to benefit US with it.\"  \"I have no patience with him,\" observed Scrooge\\'s niece. Scrooge\\'s niece\\'s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.  \"Oh, I have!\" said Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"I am sorry for him; I couldn\\'t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won\\'t come and dine with us. What\\'s the consequence? He don\\'t lose much of a dinner.\"  \"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\" interrupted Scrooge\\'s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.  \"Well! I\\'m very glad to hear it,\" said Scrooge\\'s nephew, \"because I haven\\'t great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Topper?\"  Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge\\'s niece\\'s sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge\\'s niece\\'s sister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.  \"Do go on, Fred,\" said Scrooge\\'s niece, clapping her hands. \"He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!\"  Scrooge\\'s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.  \"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge\\'s nephew, \"that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can\\'t help thinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that\\'s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.\"  It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.  After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it. Scrooge\\'s niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton\\'s spade that buried Jacob Marley.  But they didn\\'t devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man\\'s buff. Of course there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge\\'s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn\\'t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn\\'t fair; and it really was not. But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains.  Scrooge\\'s niece was not one of the blind-man\\'s buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge\\'s nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.  The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.  \"Here is a new game,\" said Scrooge. \"One half hour, Spirit, only one!\"  It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge\\'s nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn\\'t made a show of, and wasn\\'t led by anybody, and didn\\'t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:  \"I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!\"  \"What is it?\" cried Fred.  \"It\\'s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!\"  Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to \"Is it a bear?\" ought to have been \"Yes;\" inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.  \"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,\" said Fred, \"and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, \\'Uncle Scrooge!\\'\"  \"Well! Uncle Scrooge!\" they cried.  \"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!\" said Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"He wouldn\\'t take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!\"  Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.  Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery\\'s every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.  It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children\\'s Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey.  \"Are spirits\\' lives so short?\" asked Scrooge.  \"My life upon this globe, is very brief,\" replied the Ghost. \"It ends to-night.\"  \"To-night!\" cried Scrooge.  \"To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.\"  The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.  \"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,\" said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit\\'s robe, \"but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?\"  \"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,\" was the Spirit\\'s sorrowful reply. \"Look here.\"  From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.  \"Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!\" exclaimed the Ghost.  They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.  Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.  \"Spirit! are they yours?\" Scrooge could say no more.  \"They are Man\\'s,\" said the Spirit, looking down upon them. \"And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!\" cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. \"Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!\"  \"Have they no refuge or resource?\" cried Scrooge.  \"Are there no prisons?\" said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. \"Are there no workhouses?\"  The bell struck twelve.  Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.   STAVE IV:  THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS  THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.  It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.  He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.  \"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?\" said Scrooge.  The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.  \"You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,\" Scrooge pursued. \"Is that so, Spirit?\"  The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer he received.  Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.  But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.  \"Ghost of the Future!\" he exclaimed, \"I fear you more than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?\"  It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.  \"Lead on!\" said Scrooge. \"Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!\"  The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him along.  They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on \\'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.  The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.  \"No,\" said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I don\\'t know much about it, either way. I only know he\\'s dead.\"  \"When did he die?\" inquired another.  \"Last night, I believe.\"  \"Why, what was the matter with him?\" asked a third, taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. \"I thought he\\'d never die.\"  \"God knows,\" said the first, with a yawn.  \"What has he done with his money?\" asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.  \"I haven\\'t heard,\" said the man with the large chin, yawning again. \"Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn\\'t left it to me. That\\'s all I know.\"  This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.  \"It\\'s likely to be a very cheap funeral,\" said the same speaker; \"for upon my life I don\\'t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?\"  \"I don\\'t mind going if a lunch is provided,\" observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. \"But I must be fed, if I make one.\"  Another laugh.  \"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\" said the first speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I\\'ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I\\'m not at all sure that I wasn\\'t his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!\"  Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.  The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.  He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.  \"How are you?\" said one.  \"How are you?\" returned the other.  \"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\"  \"So I am told,\" returned the second. \"Cold, isn\\'t it?\"  \"Seasonable for Christmas time. You\\'re not a skater, I suppose?\"  \"No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!\"  Not another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.  Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost\\'s province was the Future. Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy.  He looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this.  Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel very cold.  They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.  Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.  Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.  \"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\" cried she who had entered first. \"Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker\\'s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here\\'s a chance! If we haven\\'t all three met here without meaning it!\"  \"You couldn\\'t have met in a better place,\" said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth. \"Come into the parlour. You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an\\'t strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an\\'t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I\\'m sure there\\'s no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We\\'re all suitable to our calling, we\\'re well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.\"  The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.  While he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.  \"What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?\" said the woman. \"Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did.\"  \"That\\'s true, indeed!\" said the laundress. \"No man more so.\"  \"Why then, don\\'t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who\\'s the wiser? We\\'re not going to pick holes in each other\\'s coats, I suppose?\"  \"No, indeed!\" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. \"We should hope not.\"  \"Very well, then!\" cried the woman. \"That\\'s enough. Who\\'s the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose.\"  \"No, indeed,\" said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.  \"If he wanted to keep \\'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,\" pursued the woman, \"why wasn\\'t he natural in his lifetime? If he had been, he\\'d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.\"  \"It\\'s the truest word that ever was spoke,\" said Mrs. Dilber. \"It\\'s a judgment on him.\"  \"I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\" replied the woman; \"and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I\\'m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It\\'s no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.\"  But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come.  \"That\\'s your account,\" said Joe, \"and I wouldn\\'t give another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who\\'s next?\"  Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.  \"I always give too much to ladies. It\\'s a weakness of mine, and that\\'s the way I ruin myself,\" said old Joe. \"That\\'s your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I\\'d repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.\"  \"And now undo my bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman.  Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.  \"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains!\"  \"Ah!\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. \"Bed-curtains!\"  \"You don\\'t mean to say you took \\'em down, rings and all, with him lying there?\" said Joe.  \"Yes I do,\" replied the woman. \"Why not?\"  \"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and you\\'ll certainly do it.\"  \"I certainly shan\\'t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe,\" returned the woman coolly. \"Don\\'t drop that oil upon the blankets, now.\"  \"His blankets?\" asked Joe.  \"Whose else\\'s do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He isn\\'t likely to take cold without \\'em, I dare say.\"  \"I hope he didn\\'t die of anything catching? Eh?\" said old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.  \"Don\\'t you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I an\\'t so fond of his company that I\\'d loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won\\'t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It\\'s the best he had, and a fine one too. They\\'d have wasted it, if it hadn\\'t been for me.\"  \"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe.  \"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied the woman with a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If calico an\\'t good enough for such a purpose, it isn\\'t good enough for anything. It\\'s quite as becoming to the body. He can\\'t look uglier than he did in that one.\"  Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man\\'s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.  \"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. \"This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!\"  \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. \"I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!\"  He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful language.  The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.  Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge\\'s part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.  Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a man\\'s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!  No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge\\'s ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!  He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.  \"Spirit!\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\"  Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.  \"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.\"  Again it seemed to look upon him.  \"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man\\'s death,\" said Scrooge quite agonised, \"show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!\"  The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her children were.  She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked up and down the room; started at every sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play.  At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.  He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.  \"Is it good?\" she said, \"or bad?\"--to help him.  \"Bad,\" he answered.  \"We are quite ruined?\"  \"No. There is hope yet, Caroline.\"  \"If he relents,\" she said, amazed, \"there is! Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.\"  \"He is past relenting,\" said her husband. \"He is dead.\"  She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.  \"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week\\'s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.\"  \"To whom will our debt be transferred?\"  \"I don\\'t know. But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!\"  Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The children\\'s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man\\'s death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure.  \"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,\" said Scrooge; \"or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever present to me.\"  The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit\\'s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.  Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!  \"\\'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.\\'\"  Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on?  The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.  \"The colour hurts my eyes,\" she said.  The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!  \"They\\'re better now again,\" said Cratchit\\'s wife. \"It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn\\'t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.\"  \"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book. \"But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother.\"  They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:  \"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.\"  \"And so have I,\" cried Peter. \"Often.\"  \"And so have I,\" exclaimed another. So had all.  \"But he was very light to carry,\" she resumed, intent upon her work, \"and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!\"  She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter --he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, \"Don\\'t mind it, father. Don\\'t be grieved!\"  Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday, he said.  \"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his wife.  \"Yes, my dear,\" returned Bob. \"I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you\\'ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!\" cried Bob. \"My little child!\"  He broke down all at once. He couldn\\'t help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were.  He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.  They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge\\'s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little--\"just a little down you know,\" said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. \"On which,\" said Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. \\'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,\\' he said, \\'and heartily sorry for your good wife.\\' By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don\\'t know.\"  \"Knew what, my dear?\"  \"Why, that you were a good wife,\" replied Bob.  \"Everybody knows that!\" said Peter.  \"Very well observed, my boy!\" cried Bob. \"I hope they do. \\'Heartily sorry,\\' he said, \\'for your good wife. If I can be of service to you in any way,\\' he said, giving me his card, \\'that\\'s where I live. Pray come to me.\\' Now, it wasn\\'t,\" cried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us.\"  \"I\\'m sure he\\'s a good soul!\" said Mrs. Cratchit.  \"You would be surer of it, my dear,\" returned Bob, \"if you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn\\'t be at all surprised-- mark what I say!--if he got Peter a better situation.\"  \"Only hear that, Peter,\" said Mrs. Cratchit.  \"And then,\" cried one of the girls, \"Peter will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.\"  \"Get along with you!\" retorted Peter, grinning.  \"It\\'s just as likely as not,\" said Bob, \"one of these days; though there\\'s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this first parting that there was among us?\"  \"Never, father!\" cried they all.  \"And I know,\" said Bob, \"I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.\"  \"No, never, father!\" they all cried again.  \"I am very happy,\" said little Bob, \"I am very happy!\"  Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God!  \"Spectre,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?\"  The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.  \"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be, in days to come!\"  The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.  \"The house is yonder,\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"Why do you point away?\"  The inexorable finger underwent no change.  Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.  He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round before entering.  A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation\\'s death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place!  The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.  \"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\" said Scrooge, \"answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?\"  Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.  \"Men\\'s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,\" said Scrooge. \"But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!\"  The Spirit was immovable as ever.  Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.  \"Am I that man who lay upon the bed?\" he cried, upon his knees.  The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.  \"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!\"  The finger still was there.  \"Spirit!\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, \"hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!\"  For the first time the hand appeared to shake.  \"Good Spirit,\" he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: \"Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life!\"  The kind hand trembled.  \"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!\"  In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.  Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom\\'s hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.   STAVE V:  THE END OF IT  YES! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in!  \"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!\" Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. \"The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley! Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!\"  He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with tears.  \"They are not torn down,\" cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, \"they are not torn down, rings and all. They are here--I am here--the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled. They will be. I know they will!\"  His hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance.  \"I don\\'t know what to do!\" cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the same breath; and making a perfect LaocoÃ¶n of himself with his stockings. \"I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!\"  He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there: perfectly winded.  \"There\\'s the saucepan that the gruel was in!\" cried Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace. \"There\\'s the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There\\'s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat! There\\'s the window where I saw the wandering Spirits! It\\'s all right, it\\'s all true, it all happened. Ha ha ha!\"  Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!  \"I don\\'t know what day of the month it is!\" said Scrooge. \"I don\\'t know how long I\\'ve been among the Spirits. I don\\'t know anything. I\\'m quite a baby. Never mind. I don\\'t care. I\\'d rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!\"  He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang, hammer; ding, dong, bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!  Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!  \"What\\'s to-day!\" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.  \"EH?\" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.  \"What\\'s to-day, my fine fellow?\" said Scrooge.  \"To-day!\" replied the boy. \"Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.\"  \"It\\'s Christmas Day!\" said Scrooge to himself. \"I haven\\'t missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!\"  \"Hallo!\" returned the boy.  \"Do you know the Poulterer\\'s, in the next street but one, at the corner?\" Scrooge inquired.  \"I should hope I did,\" replied the lad.  \"An intelligent boy!\" said Scrooge. \"A remarkable boy! Do you know whether they\\'ve sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there?--Not the little prize Turkey: the big one?\"  \"What, the one as big as me?\" returned the boy.  \"What a delightful boy!\" said Scrooge. \"It\\'s a pleasure to talk to him. Yes, my buck!\"  \"It\\'s hanging there now,\" replied the boy.  \"Is it?\" said Scrooge. \"Go and buy it.\"  \"Walk-ER!\" exclaimed the boy.  \"No, no,\" said Scrooge, \"I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell \\'em to bring it here, that I may give them the direction where to take it. Come back with the man, and I\\'ll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than five minutes and I\\'ll give you half-a-crown!\"  The boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.  \"I\\'ll send it to Bob Cratchit\\'s!\" whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. \"He sha\\'n\\'t know who sends it. It\\'s twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob\\'s will be!\"  The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer\\'s man. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye.  \"I shall love it, as long as I live!\" cried Scrooge, patting it with his hand. \"I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it has in its face! It\\'s a wonderful knocker!--Here\\'s the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!\"  It was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird. He would have snapped \\'em short off in a minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.  \"Why, it\\'s impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\" said Scrooge. \"You must have a cab.\"  The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried.  Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don\\'t dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.  He dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and at last got out into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows said, \"Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!\" And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.  He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and said, \"Scrooge and Marley\\'s, I believe?\"  It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.  \"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old gentleman by both his hands. \"How do you do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!\"  \"Mr. Scrooge?\"  \"Yes,\" said Scrooge. \"That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in his ear.  \"Lord bless me!\" cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away. \"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\"  \"If you please,\" said Scrooge. \"Not a farthing less. A great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that favour?\"  \"My dear sir,\" said the other, shaking hands with him. \"I don\\'t know what to say to such munifi--\"  \"Don\\'t say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge. \"Come and see me. Will you come and see me?\"  \"I will!\" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.  \"Thank\\'ee,\" said Scrooge. \"I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty times. Bless you!\"  He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew\\'s house.  He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and did it:  \"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the girl. Nice girl! Very.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Where is he, my love?\" said Scrooge.  \"He\\'s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I\\'ll show you up-stairs, if you please.\"  \"Thank\\'ee. He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room lock. \"I\\'ll go in here, my dear.\"  He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see that everything is right.  \"Fred!\" said Scrooge.  Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn\\'t have done it, on any account.  \"Why bless my soul!\" cried Fred, \"who\\'s that?\"  \"It\\'s I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in, Fred?\"  Let him in! It is a mercy he didn\\'t shake his arm off. He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did every one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!  But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his heart upon.  And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.  His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o\\'clock.  \"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as he could feign it. \"What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?\"  \"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Bob. \"I am behind my time.\"  \"You are?\" repeated Scrooge. \"Yes. I think you are. Step this way, sir, if you please.\"  \"It\\'s only once a year, sir,\" pleaded Bob, appearing from the Tank. \"It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.\"  \"Now, I\\'ll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge, \"I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,\" he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again; \"and therefore I am about to raise your salary!\"  Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.  \"A merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. \"A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year! I\\'ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\"   Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.  He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!     *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A CHRISTMAS CAROL ***  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

The Period   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.  There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.  It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.  France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.  In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterersâ\\x80\\x99 warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of â\\x80\\x9cthe Captain,â\\x80\\x9d gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, â\\x80\\x9cin consequence of the failure of his ammunition:â\\x80\\x9d after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Gilesâ\\x80\\x99s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmerâ\\x80\\x99s boy of sixpence.  All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them.     CHAPTER II. The Mail   It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooterâ\\x80\\x99s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.  With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary â\\x80\\x9cWo-ho! so-ho-then!â\\x80\\x9d the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.  There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.  Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in â\\x80\\x9cthe Captainâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x9d pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooterâ\\x80\\x99s Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.  The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.  â\\x80\\x9cWo-ho!â\\x80\\x9d said the coachman. â\\x80\\x9cSo, then! One more pull and youâ\\x80\\x99re at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!--Joe!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHalloa!â\\x80\\x9d the guard replied.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat oâ\\x80\\x99clock do you make it, Joe?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTen minutes, good, past eleven.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy blood!â\\x80\\x9d ejaculated the vexed coachman, â\\x80\\x9cand not atop of Shooterâ\\x80\\x99s yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!â\\x80\\x9d  The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.  The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.  â\\x80\\x9cTst! Joe!â\\x80\\x9d cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you say, Tom?â\\x80\\x9d  They both listened.  â\\x80\\x9cI say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,â\\x80\\x9d returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. â\\x80\\x9cGentlemen! In the kingâ\\x80\\x99s name, all of you!â\\x80\\x9d  With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive.  The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting.  The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.  The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.  â\\x80\\x9cSo-ho!â\\x80\\x9d the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. â\\x80\\x9cYo there! Stand! I shall fire!â\\x80\\x9d  The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a manâ\\x80\\x99s voice called from the mist, â\\x80\\x9cIs that the Dover mail?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNever you mind what it is!â\\x80\\x9d the guard retorted. â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_Is_ that the Dover mail?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy do you want to know?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI want a passenger, if it is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat passenger?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Jarvis Lorry.â\\x80\\x9d  Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.  â\\x80\\x9cKeep where you are,â\\x80\\x9d the guard called to the voice in the mist, â\\x80\\x9cbecause, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter?â\\x80\\x9d asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. â\\x80\\x9cWho wants me? Is it Jerry?â\\x80\\x9d  (â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t like Jerryâ\\x80\\x99s voice, if it is Jerry,â\\x80\\x9d growled the guard to himself. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.â\\x80\\x9d)  â\\x80\\x9cYes, Mr. Lorry.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI know this messenger, guard,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window. â\\x80\\x9cHe may come close; thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing wrong.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI hope there ainâ\\x80\\x99t, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t make so â\\x80\\x98Nation sure of that,â\\x80\\x9d said the guard, in gruff soliloquy. â\\x80\\x9cHallo you!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell! And hallo you!â\\x80\\x9d said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.  â\\x80\\x9cCome on at a footpace! dâ\\x80\\x99ye mind me? And if youâ\\x80\\x99ve got holsters to that saddle oâ\\x80\\x99 yourn, donâ\\x80\\x99t let me see your hand go nigh â\\x80\\x99em. For Iâ\\x80\\x99m a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So now letâ\\x80\\x99s look at you.â\\x80\\x9d  The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper. The riderâ\\x80\\x99s horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man.  â\\x80\\x9cGuard!â\\x80\\x9d said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.  The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, â\\x80\\x9cSir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank. You must know Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown to drink. I may read this?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf so be as youâ\\x80\\x99re quick, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read--first to himself and then aloud: â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Wait at Dover for Mamâ\\x80\\x99selle.â\\x80\\x99 Itâ\\x80\\x99s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE.â\\x80\\x9d  Jerry started in his saddle. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a Blazing strange answer, too,â\\x80\\x9d  said he, at his hoarsest.  â\\x80\\x9cTake that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.â\\x80\\x9d  With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.  The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few smithâ\\x80\\x99s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.  â\\x80\\x9cTom!â\\x80\\x9d softly over the coach roof.  â\\x80\\x9cHallo, Joe.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDid you hear the message?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI did, Joe.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat did you make of it, Tom?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNothing at all, Joe.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a coincidence, too,â\\x80\\x9d the guard mused, â\\x80\\x9cfor I made the same of it myself.â\\x80\\x9d  Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.  â\\x80\\x9cAfter that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level,â\\x80\\x9d said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his mare. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Recalled to life.â\\x80\\x99 Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a Blazing strange message. Much of that wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! Youâ\\x80\\x99d be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER III. The Night Shadows   A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my lifeâ\\x80\\x99s end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?  As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him and the next.  The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearerâ\\x80\\x99s knees. When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.  â\\x80\\x9cNo, Jerry, no!â\\x80\\x9d said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode. â\\x80\\x9cIt wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I donâ\\x80\\x99t think heâ\\x80\\x99d been a drinking!â\\x80\\x9d  His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was so like Smithâ\\x80\\x99s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.  While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.  What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.  Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then the strong-rooms underground, at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.  But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.  Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre:  â\\x80\\x9cBuried how long?â\\x80\\x9d  The answer was always the same: â\\x80\\x9cAlmost eighteen years.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou had abandoned all hope of being dug out?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLong ago.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou know that you are recalled to life?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey tell me so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI hope you care to live?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t say.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?â\\x80\\x9d  The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, â\\x80\\x9cWait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.â\\x80\\x9d  Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was, â\\x80\\x9cTake me to her.â\\x80\\x9d Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know her. I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand.â\\x80\\x9d  After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.  Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again.  â\\x80\\x9cBuried how long?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAlmost eighteen years.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI hope you care to live?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t say.â\\x80\\x9d  Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave.  â\\x80\\x9cBuried how long?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAlmost eighteen years.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou had abandoned all hope of being dug out?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLong ago.â\\x80\\x9d  The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of the night were gone.  He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.  â\\x80\\x9cEighteen years!â\\x80\\x9d said the passenger, looking at the sun. â\\x80\\x9cGracious Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER IV. The Preparation   When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon, the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.  By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.  â\\x80\\x9cThere will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed, sir?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please. Show Concord! Gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.) Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!â\\x80\\x9d  The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast.  The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.  Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.  Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:  â\\x80\\x9cI wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank. Please to let me know.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank in London, sir?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Companyâ\\x80\\x99s House.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last from France.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our peopleâ\\x80\\x99s time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI believe so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen years ago?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from the truth.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, sir!â\\x80\\x9d  Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.  When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.  As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts seemed to cloud too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.  A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work. Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.  He set down his glass untouched. â\\x80\\x9cThis is Mamâ\\x80\\x99selle!â\\x80\\x9d said he.  In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s.  â\\x80\\x9cSo soon?â\\x80\\x9d  Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.  The gentleman from Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manetteâ\\x80\\x99s apartment. It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out.  The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.  â\\x80\\x9cPray take a seat, sir.â\\x80\\x9d In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.  â\\x80\\x9cI kiss your hand, miss,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.  â\\x80\\x9cI received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that some intelligence--or discovery--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe word is not material, miss; either word will do.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so long dead--â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets!  â\\x80\\x9c--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMyself.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAs I was prepared to hear, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she. He made her another bow.  â\\x80\\x9cI replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s protection. The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI was happy,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cto be entrusted with the charge. I shall be more happy to execute it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNaturally,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cYes--I--â\\x80\\x9d  After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears, â\\x80\\x9cIt is very difficult to begin.â\\x80\\x9d  He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand, as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing shadow.  â\\x80\\x9cAre you quite a stranger to me, sir?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAm I not?â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile.  Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the moment she raised her eyes again, went on:  â\\x80\\x9cIn your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you as a young English lady, Miss Manette?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf you please, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to acquit myself of. In your reception of it, donâ\\x80\\x99t heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cStory!â\\x80\\x9d  He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added, in a hurry, â\\x80\\x9cYes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot of Beauvais?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there. Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that time in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAt that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s hands. In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine. To go on--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut this is my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s story, sir; and I begin to thinkâ\\x80\\x9d--the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--â\\x80\\x9cthat when I was left an orphan through my motherâ\\x80\\x99s surviving my father only two years, it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his.  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle.â\\x80\\x9d  After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and resumed his former attitude.  â\\x80\\x9cSo far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died when he did--Donâ\\x80\\x99t be frightened! How you start!â\\x80\\x9d  She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.  â\\x80\\x9cPray,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble: â\\x80\\x9cpray control your agitation--a matter of business. As I was saying--â\\x80\\x9d  Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:  â\\x80\\x9cAs I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI entreat you to tell me more, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI will. I am going to. You can bear it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s good!â\\x80\\x9d (Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.) â\\x80\\x9cA matter of business. Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now if this doctorâ\\x80\\x99s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe little child was a daughter, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA daughter. A-a-matter of business--donâ\\x80\\x99t be distressed. Miss, if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born, that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, donâ\\x80\\x99t kneel! In Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s name why should you kneel to me!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFor the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind.â\\x80\\x9d  Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right, thatâ\\x80\\x99s right. Courage! Business! You have business before you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with you. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.â\\x80\\x9d  As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.  â\\x80\\x9cYou know that your parents had no great possession, and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--â\\x80\\x9d  He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.  â\\x80\\x9cBut he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best. Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.â\\x80\\x9d  A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,  â\\x80\\x9cI am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. â\\x80\\x9cThere, there, there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now. You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.â\\x80\\x9d  She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, â\\x80\\x9cI have been free, I have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOnly one thing more,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention: â\\x80\\x9che has been found under another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all events--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, â\\x80\\x98Recalled to Life;â\\x80\\x99 which may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesnâ\\x80\\x99t notice a word! Miss Manette!â\\x80\\x9d  Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving.  A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him flying back against the nearest wall.  (â\\x80\\x9cI really think this must be a man!â\\x80\\x9d was Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s breathless reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)  â\\x80\\x9cWhy, look at you all!â\\x80\\x9d bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants. â\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you go and fetch things? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let you know, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will.â\\x80\\x9d  There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and gentleness: calling her â\\x80\\x9cmy precious!â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cmy bird!â\\x80\\x9d and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd you in brown!â\\x80\\x9d she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry; â\\x80\\x9ccouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do you call _that_ being a Banker?â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of â\\x80\\x9cletting them knowâ\\x80\\x9d something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder.  â\\x80\\x9cI hope she will do well now,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cNo thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI hope,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, â\\x80\\x9cthat you accompany Miss Manette to France?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA likely thing, too!â\\x80\\x9d replied the strong woman. â\\x80\\x9cIf it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?â\\x80\\x9d  This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it.     CHAPTER V. The Wine-shop   A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.  All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from womenâ\\x80\\x99s heads, which were squeezed dry into infantsâ\\x80\\x99 mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.  A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women, and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.  The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again. Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.  The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.  And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the bakerâ\\x80\\x99s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil.  Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutlerâ\\x80\\x99s knives and axes were sharp and bright, the smithâ\\x80\\x99s hammers were heavy, and the gunmakerâ\\x80\\x99s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.  For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.  The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not my affair,â\\x80\\x9d said he, with a final shrug of the shoulders. â\\x80\\x9cThe people from the market did it. Let them bring another.â\\x80\\x9d  There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke, he called to him across the way:  â\\x80\\x9cSay, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?â\\x80\\x9d  The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?â\\x80\\x9d said the wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. â\\x80\\x9cWhy do you write in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place to write such words in?â\\x80\\x9d  In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) upon the jokerâ\\x80\\x99s heart. The joker rapped it with his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.  â\\x80\\x9cPut it on, put it on,â\\x80\\x9d said the other. â\\x80\\x9cCall wine, wine; and finish there.â\\x80\\x9d With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the jokerâ\\x80\\x99s dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.  This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder. His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn the man.  Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.  The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, â\\x80\\x9cThis is our man.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur Defarge to himself; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know you.â\\x80\\x9d  But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.  â\\x80\\x9cHow goes it, Jacques?â\\x80\\x9d said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cIs all the spilt wine swallowed?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEvery drop, Jacques,â\\x80\\x9d answered Monsieur Defarge.  When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is not often,â\\x80\\x9d said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, â\\x80\\x9cthat many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is so, Jacques,â\\x80\\x9d Monsieur Defarge returned.  At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.  The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips.  â\\x80\\x9cAh! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I right, Jacques?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are right, Jacques,â\\x80\\x9d was the response of Monsieur Defarge.  This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat.  â\\x80\\x9cHold then! True!â\\x80\\x9d muttered her husband. â\\x80\\x9cGentlemen--my wife!â\\x80\\x9d  The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.  â\\x80\\x9cGentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her, â\\x80\\x9cgood day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here,â\\x80\\x9d pointing with his hand, â\\x80\\x9cnear to the window of my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!â\\x80\\x9d  They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.  â\\x80\\x9cWillingly, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to the door.  Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.  Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry, dangerous man.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.â\\x80\\x9d  Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began ascending the stairs.  â\\x80\\x9cIs he alone?â\\x80\\x9d the latter whispered.  â\\x80\\x9cAlone! God help him, who should be with him!â\\x80\\x9d said the other, in the same low voice.  â\\x80\\x9cIs he always alone, then?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOf his own desire?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOf his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be discreet--as he was then, so he is now.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe is greatly changed?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cChanged!â\\x80\\x9d  The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand, and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so forcible. Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher.  Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say, the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companionâ\\x80\\x99s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.  At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key.  â\\x80\\x9cThe door is locked then, my friend?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, surprised.  â\\x80\\x9cAy. Yes,â\\x80\\x9d was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cYou think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think it necessary to turn the key.â\\x80\\x9d Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.  â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what harm--if his door was left open.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs it possible!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cIs it possible!â\\x80\\x9d repeated Defarge, bitterly. â\\x80\\x9cYes. And a beautiful world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.â\\x80\\x9d  This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s ears. But, by this time she trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.  â\\x80\\x9cCourage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!â\\x80\\x9d  They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop.  â\\x80\\x9cI forgot them in the surprise of your visit,â\\x80\\x9d explained Monsieur Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cLeave us, good boys; we have business here.â\\x80\\x9d  The three glided by, and went silently down.  There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:  â\\x80\\x9cDo you make a show of Monsieur Manette?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs that well?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_I_ think it is well.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWho are the few? How do you choose them?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.â\\x80\\x9d  With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned it as heavily as he could.  The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.  He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry got his arm securely round the daughterâ\\x80\\x99s waist, and held her; for he felt that she was sinking.  â\\x80\\x9cA-a-a-business, business!â\\x80\\x9d he urged, with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek. â\\x80\\x9cCome in, come in!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am afraid of it,â\\x80\\x9d she answered, shuddering.  â\\x80\\x9cOf it? What?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI mean of him. Of my father.â\\x80\\x9d  Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.  Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside, took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.  The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way. Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.     CHAPTER VI. The Shoemaker   â\\x80\\x9cGood day!â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking.  It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the salutation, as if it were at a distance:  â\\x80\\x9cGood day!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are still hard at work, I see?â\\x80\\x9d  After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the voice replied, â\\x80\\x9cYes--I am working.â\\x80\\x9d This time, a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.  The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.  Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.  â\\x80\\x9cI want,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, â\\x80\\x9cto let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?â\\x80\\x9d  The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat did you say?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou can bear a little more light?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI must bear it, if you let it in.â\\x80\\x9d (Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.)  The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.  He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze, pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.  â\\x80\\x9cAre you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?â\\x80\\x9d asked Defarge, motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat did you say?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x9d  But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.  Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The look and the action had occupied but an instant.  â\\x80\\x9cYou have a visitor, you see,â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat did you say?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHere is a visitor.â\\x80\\x9d  The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his work.  â\\x80\\x9cCome!â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cHere is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.  â\\x80\\x9cTell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the makerâ\\x80\\x99s name.â\\x80\\x9d  There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:  â\\x80\\x9cI forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI said, couldnâ\\x80\\x99t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieurâ\\x80\\x99s information?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is a ladyâ\\x80\\x99s shoe. It is a young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s walking-shoe. It is in the present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.â\\x80\\x9d He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd the makerâ\\x80\\x99s name?â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge.  Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a momentâ\\x80\\x99s intermission. The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man.  â\\x80\\x9cDid you ask me for my name?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAssuredly I did.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOne Hundred and Five, North Tower.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs that all?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOne Hundred and Five, North Tower.â\\x80\\x9d  With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work again, until the silence was again broken.  â\\x80\\x9cYou are not a shoemaker by trade?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him.  His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground.  â\\x80\\x9cI am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--â\\x80\\x9d  He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a subject of last night.  â\\x80\\x9cI asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.â\\x80\\x9d  As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:  â\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?â\\x80\\x9d  The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner.  â\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Manetteâ\\x80\\x9d; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s arm; â\\x80\\x9cdo you remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?â\\x80\\x9d  As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.  Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work.  â\\x80\\x9cHave you recognised him, monsieur?â\\x80\\x9d asked Defarge in a whisper.  â\\x80\\x9cYes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!â\\x80\\x9d  She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour.  Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit, beside him, and he bent over his work.  It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand, for his shoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s knife. It lay on that side of him which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward, but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife, though they had.  He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is this?â\\x80\\x9d  With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she laid his ruined head there.  â\\x80\\x9cYou are not the gaolerâ\\x80\\x99s daughter?â\\x80\\x9d  She sighed â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWho are you?â\\x80\\x9d  Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.  Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking.  But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.  He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. â\\x80\\x9cIt is the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!â\\x80\\x9d  As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the light, and looked at her.  â\\x80\\x9cShe had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. â\\x80\\x98You will leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they may in the spirit.â\\x80\\x99 Those were the words I said. I remember them very well.â\\x80\\x9d  He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it. But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently, though slowly.  â\\x80\\x9cHow was this?--_Was it you_?â\\x80\\x9d  Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only said, in a low voice, â\\x80\\x9cI entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near us, do not speak, do not move!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHark!â\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. â\\x80\\x9cWhose voice was that?â\\x80\\x9d  His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and gloomily shook his head.  â\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It canâ\\x80\\x99t be. See what the prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your name, my gentle angel?â\\x80\\x9d  Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.  â\\x80\\x9cO, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!â\\x80\\x9d  His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.  â\\x80\\x9cIf you hear in my voice--I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that it is so, but I hope it is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!â\\x80\\x9d  She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a child.  â\\x80\\x9cIf, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank God for us, thank God!â\\x80\\x9d  He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.  When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.  â\\x80\\x9cIf, without disturbing him,â\\x80\\x9d she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, â\\x80\\x9call could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he could be taken away--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut, consider. Is he fit for the journey?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cMore fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to him.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is true,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. â\\x80\\x9cMore than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France. Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s business,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners; â\\x80\\x9cand if business is to be done, I had better do it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen be so kind,â\\x80\\x9d urged Miss Manette, â\\x80\\x9cas to leave us here. You see how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back, as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until you return, and then we will remove him straight.â\\x80\\x9d  Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away to do it.  Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the fatherâ\\x80\\x99s side, and watched him. The darkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall.  Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the lamp he carried, on the shoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s bench (there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and assisted him to his feet.  No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.  In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand in both his own.  They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr. Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and round at the walls.  â\\x80\\x9cYou remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat did you say?â\\x80\\x9d  But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it.  â\\x80\\x9cRemember? No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t remember. It was so very long ago.â\\x80\\x9d  That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter, â\\x80\\x9cOne Hundred and Five, North Tower;â\\x80\\x9d and when he looked about him, it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he dropped his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s hand and clasped his head again.  No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.  The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed him, when Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s feet were arrested on the step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.  Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word â\\x80\\x9cTo the Barrier!â\\x80\\x9d The postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps.  Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. â\\x80\\x9cYour papers, travellers!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSee here then, Monsieur the Officer,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, getting down, and taking him gravely apart, â\\x80\\x9cthese are the papers of monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with him, at the--â\\x80\\x9d He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. â\\x80\\x9cIt is well. Forward!â\\x80\\x9d from the uniform. â\\x80\\x9cAdieu!â\\x80\\x9d from Defarge. And so, under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great grove of stars.  Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black. All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:  â\\x80\\x9cI hope you care to be recalled to life?â\\x80\\x9d  And the old answer:  â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t say.â\\x80\\x9d   The end of the first book.     Book the Second--the Golden Thread     CHAPTER I. Five Years Later   Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business. Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s (they said) wanted no elbow-room, Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s wanted no light, Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s wanted no embellishment. Noakes and Co.â\\x80\\x99s might, or Snooks Brothersâ\\x80\\x99 might; but Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, thank Heaven--!  Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s. In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.  Thus it had come to pass, that Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing â\\x80\\x9cthe House,â\\x80\\x9d you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.  But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s. Death is Natureâ\\x80\\x99s remedy for all things, and why not Legislationâ\\x80\\x99s? Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. Thus, Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.  Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young man into Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.  Outside Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added appellation of Jerry.  The scene was Mr. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley, Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)  Mr. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread.  Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:  â\\x80\\x9cBust me, if she ainâ\\x80\\x99t at it agin!â\\x80\\x9d  A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re at it agin, are you?â\\x80\\x9d  After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s domestic economy, that, whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his mark--â\\x80\\x9cwhat are you up to, Aggerawayter?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI was only saying my prayers.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSaying your prayers! Youâ\\x80\\x99re a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI was not praying against you; I was praying for you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou werenâ\\x80\\x99t. And if you were, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be took the liberty with. Here! your motherâ\\x80\\x99s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s prosperity. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my son. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child.â\\x80\\x9d  Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd what do you suppose, you conceited female,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, â\\x80\\x9cthat the worth of _your_ prayers may be? Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than that.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWorth no more than that,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Cruncher. â\\x80\\x9cThey ainâ\\x80\\x99t worth much, then. Whether or no, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be prayed agin, I tell you. I canâ\\x80\\x99t afford it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and child, and not in opposition to â\\x80\\x99em. If I had had any but a unnatâ\\x80\\x99ral wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnatâ\\x80\\x99ral mother, I might have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck. B-u-u-ust me!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting on his clothes, â\\x80\\x9cif I ainâ\\x80\\x99t, what with piety and one blowed thing and another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I tell you,â\\x80\\x9d here he addressed his wife once more, â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t be gone agin, in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, Iâ\\x80\\x99m as sleepy as laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t know, if it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t for the pain in â\\x80\\x99em, which was me and which somebody else, yet Iâ\\x80\\x99m none the better for it in pocket; and itâ\\x80\\x99s my suspicion that youâ\\x80\\x99ve been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket, and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say now!â\\x80\\x9d  Growling, in addition, such phrases as â\\x80\\x9cAh! yes! Youâ\\x80\\x99re religious, too. You wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you? Not you!â\\x80\\x9d and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business. In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s did, kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of â\\x80\\x9cYou are going to flop, mother. --Halloa, father!â\\x80\\x9d and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin.  Mr. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s saying grace with particular animosity.  â\\x80\\x9cNow, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?â\\x80\\x9d  His wife explained that she had merely â\\x80\\x9casked a blessing.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t do it!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s petitions. â\\x80\\x9cI ainâ\\x80\\x99t a going to be blest out of house and home. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have my wittles blest off my table. Keep still!â\\x80\\x9d  Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day.  It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description of himself as â\\x80\\x9ca honest tradesman.â\\x80\\x9d His stock consisted of a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young Jerry, walking at his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s side, carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-manâ\\x80\\x99s feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr. Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself,--and was almost as in-looking.  Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son, extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys. The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleet-street.  The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:  â\\x80\\x9cPorter wanted!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHooray, father! Hereâ\\x80\\x99s an early job to begin with!â\\x80\\x9d  Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing, and cogitated.  â\\x80\\x9cAl-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!â\\x80\\x9d muttered young Jerry. â\\x80\\x9cWhere does my father get all that iron rust from? He donâ\\x80\\x99t get no iron rust here!â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER II. A Sight   â\\x80\\x9cYou know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?â\\x80\\x9d said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger.  â\\x80\\x9cYe-es, sir,â\\x80\\x9d returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. â\\x80\\x9cI _do_ know the Bailey.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJust so. And you know Mr. Lorry.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much better,â\\x80\\x9d said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question, â\\x80\\x9cthan I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cVery well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cInto the court, sir?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cInto the court.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to interchange the inquiry, â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think of this?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAm I to wait in the court, sir?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, as the result of that conference.  â\\x80\\x9cI am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr. Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is, to remain there until he wants you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs that all, sir?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him you are there.â\\x80\\x9d  As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note, Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting-paper stage, remarked:  â\\x80\\x9cI suppose theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be trying Forgeries this morning?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTreason!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s quartering,â\\x80\\x9d said Jerry. â\\x80\\x9cBarbarous!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is the law,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised spectacles upon him. â\\x80\\x9cIt is the law.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard enough to kill him, but itâ\\x80\\x99s wery hard to spile him, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot at all,â\\x80\\x9d retained the ancient clerk. â\\x80\\x9cSpeak well of the law. Take care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take care of itself. I give you that advice.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,â\\x80\\x9d said Jerry. â\\x80\\x9cI leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d said the old clerk; â\\x80\\x9cwe all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry ways. Here is the letter. Go along.â\\x80\\x9d  Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of, â\\x80\\x9cYou are a lean old one, too,â\\x80\\x9d made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination, and went his way.  They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it. But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s, and even died before him. For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any. So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that â\\x80\\x9cWhatever is is right;â\\x80\\x9d an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.  Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.  After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court.  â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s on?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next to.  â\\x80\\x9cNothing yet.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s coming on?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe Treason case.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe quartering one, eh?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d returned the man, with a relish; â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99ll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged, and then heâ\\x80\\x99ll be taken down and sliced before his own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on, and then his head will be chopped off, and heâ\\x80\\x99ll be cut into quarters. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the sentence.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf heâ\\x80\\x99s found Guilty, you mean to say?â\\x80\\x9d Jerry added, by way of proviso.  â\\x80\\x9cOh! theyâ\\x80\\x99ll find him guilty,â\\x80\\x9d said the other. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you be afraid of that.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.  â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s _he_ got to do with the case?â\\x80\\x9d asked the man he had spoken with.  â\\x80\\x9cBlest if I know,â\\x80\\x9d said Jerry.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBlest if I know that either,â\\x80\\x9d said Jerry.  The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there, went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.  Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him. Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain.  The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.  The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at, was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.  Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.  The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.  Over the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s head there was a mirror, to throw the light down upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it, and had passed from its surface and this earthâ\\x80\\x99s together. Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s mind. Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.  It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that corner of the Judgeâ\\x80\\x99s bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.  The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.  His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, â\\x80\\x9cWho are they?â\\x80\\x9d  Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry:  â\\x80\\x9cWitnesses.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFor which side?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAgainst.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAgainst what side?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d  The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.     CHAPTER III. A Disappointment   Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered. That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council. That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues; whereat the juryâ\\x80\\x99s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country. That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his masterâ\\x80\\x99s table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-Generalâ\\x80\\x99s) brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr. Attorney-Generalâ\\x80\\x99s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s handwriting; but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans. That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s head was taken off. That head Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone.  When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.  Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leaderâ\\x80\\x99s lead, examined the patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr. Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.  Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation. What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didnâ\\x80\\x99t precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s. Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtorsâ\\x80\\x99 prison? Didnâ\\x80\\x99t see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtorsâ\\x80\\x99 prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs? Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true? Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes. Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets? No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No. Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear no. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer patriotism? None whatever.  The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him. He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s desk. He had not put them there first. He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldnâ\\x80\\x99t bear it, and had given information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence. He didnâ\\x80\\x99t call it a particularly curious coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.  The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s bank?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOn a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt did.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWere there any other passengers in the mail?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTwo.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDid they alight on the road in the course of the night?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey did.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI cannot undertake to say that he was.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDoes he resemble either of these two passengers?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBoth were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSo at least you say he may have been one of them?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes. Except that I remember them both to have been--like myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous air.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDid you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI certainly have seen that.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him, to your certain knowledge, before?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhen?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the voyage with me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAt what hour did he come on board?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAt a little after midnight.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIn the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe happened to be the only one.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNever mind about â\\x80\\x98happening,â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe was.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWere you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWith two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette!â\\x80\\x9d  The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her, and kept her hand drawn through his arm.  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette, look upon the prisoner.â\\x80\\x9d  To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd. Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhere?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOn board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same occasion.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are the young lady just now referred to?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cO! most unhappily, I am!â\\x80\\x9d  The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: â\\x80\\x9cAnswer the questions put to you, and make no remark upon them.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cRecall it.â\\x80\\x9d  In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: â\\x80\\x9cWhen the gentleman came on board--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you mean the prisoner?â\\x80\\x9d inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.  â\\x80\\x9cYes, my Lord.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen say the prisoner.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhen the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,â\\x80\\x9d turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, â\\x80\\x9cwas much fatigued and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four. The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s state, and I am sure he felt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLet me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow many were with him?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTwo French gentlemen.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHad they conferred together?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey had conferred together until the last moment, when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHad any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSome papers had been handed about among them, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what papers.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLike these in shape and size?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPossibly, but indeed I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, although they stood whispering very near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that they looked at papers.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow, to the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s conversation, Miss Manette.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my father. I hope,â\\x80\\x9d bursting into tears, â\\x80\\x9cI may not repay him by doing him harm to-day.â\\x80\\x9d  Buzzing from the blue-flies.  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness, he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals, take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDid he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on Englandâ\\x80\\x99s part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said laughingly, and to beguile the time.â\\x80\\x9d  Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington.  Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.  â\\x80\\x9cDoctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOnce. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or three years and a half ago.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCan you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSir, I can do neither.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?â\\x80\\x9d  He answered, in a low voice, â\\x80\\x9cThere is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHas it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?â\\x80\\x9d  He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, â\\x80\\x9cA long imprisonment.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWere you newly released on the occasion in question?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey tell me so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHave you no remembrance of the occasion?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNone. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar. I have no remembrance of the process.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down together.  A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town, waiting for another person. The prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner.  â\\x80\\x9cYou say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?â\\x80\\x9d  The witness was quite sure.  â\\x80\\x9cDid you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?â\\x80\\x9d  Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.  â\\x80\\x9cLook well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,â\\x80\\x9d pointing to him who had tossed the paper over, â\\x80\\x9cand then look well upon the prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?â\\x80\\x9d  Allowing for my learned friendâ\\x80\\x99s appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber.  Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr. Stryver fitted the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s case on the jury, like a compact suit of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke. How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed (with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.  Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.  And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.  Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court, changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement. While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him, whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat, and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour, and added, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d hold half a guinea that _he_ donâ\\x80\\x99t get no law-work to do. Donâ\\x80\\x99t look like the sort of one to get any, do he?â\\x80\\x9d  Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manetteâ\\x80\\x99s head dropped upon her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly: â\\x80\\x9cOfficer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see she will fall!â\\x80\\x9d  There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud, ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.  They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward, and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down.  Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him.  â\\x80\\x9cJerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be a moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long before I can.â\\x80\\x9d  Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.  â\\x80\\x9cHow is the young lady?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShe is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she feels the better for being out of court.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell the prisoner so. It wonâ\\x80\\x99t do for a respectable bank gentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar. The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all eyes, ears, and spikes.  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darnay!â\\x80\\x9d  The prisoner came forward directly.  â\\x80\\x9cYou will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, I could. I will, if you ask it.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cartonâ\\x80\\x99s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.  â\\x80\\x9cI do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, still only half turned towards him, â\\x80\\x9cdo you expect, Mr. Darnay?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe worst.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their withdrawing is in your favour.â\\x80\\x9d  Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them.  An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale. The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along with them.  â\\x80\\x9cJerry! Jerry!â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got there.  â\\x80\\x9cHere, sir! Itâ\\x80\\x99s a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. â\\x80\\x9cQuick! Have you got it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  Hastily written on the paper was the word â\\x80\\x9cACQUITTED.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf you had sent the message, â\\x80\\x98Recalled to Life,â\\x80\\x99 again,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Jerry, as he turned, â\\x80\\x9cI should have known what you meant, this time.â\\x80\\x9d  He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else, until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion.     CHAPTER IV. Congratulatory   From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr. Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from death.  It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away.  Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she believed them over.  Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.  He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean out of the group: â\\x80\\x9cI am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr. Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,â\\x80\\x9d  said his late client, taking his hand.  â\\x80\\x9cI have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as another manâ\\x80\\x99s, I believe.â\\x80\\x9d  It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, â\\x80\\x9cMuch better,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again.  â\\x80\\x9cYou think so?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver. â\\x80\\x9cWell! you have been present all day, and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd as such,â\\x80\\x9d quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered him out of it--â\\x80\\x9cas such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver; â\\x80\\x9cI have a nightâ\\x80\\x99s work to do yet. Speak for yourself.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI speak for myself,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cand for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?â\\x80\\x9d  He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.  His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away.  â\\x80\\x9cMy father,â\\x80\\x9d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.  He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.  â\\x80\\x9cShall we go home, my father?â\\x80\\x9d  With a long breath, he answered â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morningâ\\x80\\x99s interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it.  Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.  â\\x80\\x9cSo, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?â\\x80\\x9d  Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Cartonâ\\x80\\x99s part in the dayâ\\x80\\x99s proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance.  â\\x80\\x9cIf you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, â\\x80\\x9cYou have mentioned that before, sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We have to think of the House more than ourselves.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_I_ know, _I_ know,â\\x80\\x9d rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare say.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd indeed, sir,â\\x80\\x9d pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, â\\x80\\x9cI really donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you have to do with the matter. If youâ\\x80\\x99ll excuse me, as very much your elder, for saying so, I really donâ\\x80\\x99t know that it is your business.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBusiness! Bless you, _I_ have no business,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Carton.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is a pity you have not, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think so, too.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf you had,â\\x80\\x9d pursued Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cperhaps you would attend to it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLord love you, no!--I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Carton.  â\\x80\\x9cWell, sir!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference, â\\x80\\x9cbusiness is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.--Chair there!â\\x80\\x9d  Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr. Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s. Carton, who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed then, and turned to Darnay:  â\\x80\\x9cThis is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI hardly seem yet,â\\x80\\x9d returned Charles Darnay, â\\x80\\x9cto belong to this world again.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder at it; itâ\\x80\\x99s not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI begin to think I _am_ faint.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen why the devil donâ\\x80\\x99t you dine? I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.â\\x80\\x9d  Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.  â\\x80\\x9cDo you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr. Darnay?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt must be an immense satisfaction!â\\x80\\x9d  He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large one.  â\\x80\\x9cAs to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it. It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular, you and I.â\\x80\\x9d  Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.  â\\x80\\x9cNow your dinner is done,â\\x80\\x9d Carton presently said, â\\x80\\x9cwhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you call a health, Mr. Darnay; why donâ\\x80\\x99t you give your toast?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat health? What toast?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy, itâ\\x80\\x99s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll swear itâ\\x80\\x99s there.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette, then!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette, then!â\\x80\\x9d  Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!â\\x80\\x9d  he said, filling his new goblet.  A slight frown and a laconic â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d were the answer.  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for oneâ\\x80\\x99s life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?â\\x80\\x9d  Again Darnay answered not a word.  â\\x80\\x9cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.â\\x80\\x9d  The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it.  â\\x80\\x9cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,â\\x80\\x9d was the careless rejoinder. â\\x80\\x9cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you think I particularly like you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cReally, Mr. Carton,â\\x80\\x9d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, â\\x80\\x9cI have not asked myself the question.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut ask yourself the question now.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou have acted as if you do; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you do.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_I_ donâ\\x80\\x99t think I do,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton. â\\x80\\x9cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNevertheless,â\\x80\\x9d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, â\\x80\\x9cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.â\\x80\\x9d  Carton rejoining, â\\x80\\x9cNothing in life!â\\x80\\x9d Darnay rang. â\\x80\\x9cDo you call the whole reckoning?â\\x80\\x9d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, â\\x80\\x9cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.â\\x80\\x9d  The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night. Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, â\\x80\\x9cA last word, Mr. Darnay: you think I am drunk?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThink? You know I have been drinking.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSince I must say so, I know it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMuch to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMay be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Donâ\\x80\\x99t let your sober face elate you, however; you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what it may come to. Good night!â\\x80\\x9d  When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.  â\\x80\\x9cDo you particularly like the man?â\\x80\\x9d he muttered, at his own image; â\\x80\\x9cwhy should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.â\\x80\\x9d  He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.     CHAPTER V. The Jackal   Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration. The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the drier parts of the legal race.  A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Kingâ\\x80\\x99s Bench, the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.  It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocateâ\\x80\\x99s accomplishments. But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingersâ\\x80\\x99 ends in the morning.  Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryverâ\\x80\\x99s great ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas, might have floated a kingâ\\x80\\x99s ship. Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.  â\\x80\\x9cTen oâ\\x80\\x99clock, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to wake him--â\\x80\\x9cten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_Whatâ\\x80\\x99s_ the matter?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTen oâ\\x80\\x99clock, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean? Ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock at night?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh! I remember. Very well, very well.â\\x80\\x9d  After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes, he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple, and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of Kingâ\\x80\\x99s Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.  The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.  â\\x80\\x9cYou are a little late, Memory,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver.  â\\x80\\x9cAbout the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.â\\x80\\x9d  They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers, where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.  â\\x80\\x9cYou have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTwo to-night, I think. I have been dining with the dayâ\\x80\\x99s client; or seeing him dine--itâ\\x80\\x99s all one!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.  â\\x80\\x9cYou and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.â\\x80\\x9d  Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down at the table, and said, â\\x80\\x9cNow I am ready!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers.  â\\x80\\x9cHow much?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOnly two sets of them.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGive me the worst first.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere they are, Sydney. Fire away!â\\x80\\x9d  The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.  At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver.  The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.  â\\x80\\x9cYou were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day. Every question told.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI always am sound; am I not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to it and smooth it again.â\\x80\\x9d  With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.  â\\x80\\x9cThe old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, â\\x80\\x9cthe old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in despondency!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d returned the other, sighing: â\\x80\\x9cyes! The same Sydney, with the same luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd why not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGod knows. It was my way, I suppose.â\\x80\\x9d  He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him, looking at the fire.  â\\x80\\x9cCarton,â\\x80\\x9d said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air, as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, â\\x80\\x9cyour way is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look at me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh, botheration!â\\x80\\x9d returned Sydney, with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh, â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t _you_ be moral!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow have I done what I have done?â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver; â\\x80\\x9chow do I do what I do?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPartly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But itâ\\x80\\x99s not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.  â\\x80\\x9cBefore Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,â\\x80\\x9d  pursued Carton, â\\x80\\x9cyou have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we didnâ\\x80\\x99t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always nowhere.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd whose fault was that?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cUpon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a gloomy thing, however, to talk about oneâ\\x80\\x99s own past, with the day breaking. Turn me in some other direction before I go.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, holding up his glass. â\\x80\\x9cAre you turned in a pleasant direction?â\\x80\\x9d  Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.  â\\x80\\x9cPretty witness,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered, looking down into his glass. â\\x80\\x9cI have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; whoâ\\x80\\x99s your pretty witness?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe picturesque doctorâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, Miss Manette.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_She_ pretty?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs she not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cRot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you know, Sydney,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: â\\x80\\x9cdo you know, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cQuick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a yard or two of a manâ\\x80\\x99s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass. I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have no more drink; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get to bed.â\\x80\\x9d  When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.  Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight. A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.  Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.     CHAPTER VI. Hundreds of People   The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.  On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.  A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.  The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.  There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.  Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him. His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned as much as he wanted.  These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon.  â\\x80\\x9cDoctor Manette at home?â\\x80\\x9d  Expected home.  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Lucie at home?â\\x80\\x9d  Expected home.  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Pross at home?â\\x80\\x9d  Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact.  â\\x80\\x9cAs I am at home myself,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll go upstairs.â\\x80\\x9d  Although the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved?  There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was the best room, and in it were Lucieâ\\x80\\x99s birds, and flowers, and books, and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third, changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.  â\\x80\\x9cI wonder,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, â\\x80\\x9cthat he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd why wonder at that?â\\x80\\x9d was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.  It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and had since improved.  â\\x80\\x9cI should have thought--â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry began.  â\\x80\\x9cPooh! Youâ\\x80\\x99d have thought!â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.  â\\x80\\x9cHow do you do?â\\x80\\x9d inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice.  â\\x80\\x9cI am pretty well, I thank you,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; â\\x80\\x9chow are you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNothing to boast of,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross.  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh! indeed!â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross. â\\x80\\x9cI am very much put out about my Ladybird.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFor gracious sake say something else besides â\\x80\\x98indeed,â\\x80\\x99 or youâ\\x80\\x99ll fidget me to death,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from stature) was shortness.  â\\x80\\x9cReally, then?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.  â\\x80\\x9cReally, is bad enough,â\\x80\\x9d returned Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cbut better. Yes, I am very much put out.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMay I ask the cause?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross.  â\\x80\\x9c_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHundreds,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross.  It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned, she exaggerated it.  â\\x80\\x9cDear me!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.  â\\x80\\x9cI have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing--since she was ten years old. And itâ\\x80\\x99s really very hard,â\\x80\\x9d  said Miss Pross.  Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything.  â\\x80\\x9cAll sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet, are always turning up,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross. â\\x80\\x9cWhen you began it--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_I_ began it, Miss Pross?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDidnâ\\x80\\x99t you? Who brought her father to life?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh! If _that_ was beginning it--â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven him), to take Ladybirdâ\\x80\\x99s affections away from me.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s.  â\\x80\\x9cThere never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross; â\\x80\\x9cand that was my brother Solomon, if he hadnâ\\x80\\x99t made a mistake in life.â\\x80\\x9d  Here again: Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s inquiries into Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction. Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s fidelity of belief in Solomon (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.  â\\x80\\x9cAs we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business,â\\x80\\x9d he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations, â\\x80\\x9clet me ask you--does the Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNever.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. â\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t say he donâ\\x80\\x99t refer to it within himself.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you believe that he thinks of it much?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross.  â\\x80\\x9cDo you imagine--â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up short with:  â\\x80\\x9cNever imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose, sometimes?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow and then,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross.  â\\x80\\x9cDo you suppose,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, â\\x80\\x9cthat Doctor Manette has any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his oppressor?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd that is--?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat she thinks he has.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow donâ\\x80\\x99t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDull?â\\x80\\x9d Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.  Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, â\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss Pross, I donâ\\x80\\x99t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of zealous interest.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell! To the best of my understanding, and badâ\\x80\\x99s the best, youâ\\x80\\x99ll tell me,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, â\\x80\\x9che is afraid of the whole subject.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAfraid?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a dreadful remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t make the subject pleasant, I should think.â\\x80\\x9d  It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. â\\x80\\x9cTrue,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cand fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t be helped,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, shaking her head. â\\x80\\x9cTouch that string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone. In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to himself.â\\x80\\x9d  Notwithstanding Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s denial of her own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her possessing such a thing.  The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going.  â\\x80\\x9cHere they are!â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference; â\\x80\\x9cand now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!â\\x80\\x9d  It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them.  Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darlingâ\\x80\\x99s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too, beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s prediction.  Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be better. Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or Cinderellaâ\\x80\\x99s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she pleased.  On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s table, but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybirdâ\\x80\\x99s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.  It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her, they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some time before, as Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads.  Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he was only One.  Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, â\\x80\\x9ca fit of the jerks.â\\x80\\x9d  The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness.  He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. â\\x80\\x9cPray, Doctor Manette,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London--â\\x80\\x9chave you seen much of the Tower?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_I_ have been there, as you remember,â\\x80\\x9d said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, â\\x80\\x9cin another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a curious thing when I was there.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat was that?â\\x80\\x9d Lucie asked.  â\\x80\\x9cIn making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy father,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Lucie, â\\x80\\x9cyou are ill!â\\x80\\x9d  He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and his look quite terrified them all.  â\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they made me start. We had better go in.â\\x80\\x9d  He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.  He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and that the rain had startled him.  Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he made only Two.  The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.  â\\x80\\x9cThe rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,â\\x80\\x9d said Doctor Manette. â\\x80\\x9cIt comes slowly.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt comes surely,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton.  They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.  There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there.  â\\x80\\x9cA multitude of people, and yet a solitude!â\\x80\\x9d said Darnay, when they had listened for a while.  â\\x80\\x9cIs it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?â\\x80\\x9d asked Lucie. â\\x80\\x9cSometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and solemn--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLet us shudder too. We may know what it is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.  The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in the distant streets, and not one within sight.  â\\x80\\x9cAre all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or are we to divide them among us?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life, and my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI take them into mine!â\\x80\\x9d said Carton. â\\x80\\x9c_I_ ask no questions and make no stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette, and I see them--by the Lightning.â\\x80\\x9d He added the last words, after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd I hear them!â\\x80\\x9d he added again, after a peal of thunder. â\\x80\\x9cHere they come, fast, fierce, and furious!â\\x80\\x9d  It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him, for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a momentâ\\x80\\x99s interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at midnight.  The great bell of Saint Paulâ\\x80\\x99s was striking one in the cleared air, when Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cto bring the dead out of their graves.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI never see the night myself, master--nor yet I donâ\\x80\\x99t expect to--what would do that,â\\x80\\x9d answered Jerry.  â\\x80\\x9cGood night, Mr. Carton,â\\x80\\x9d said the man of business. â\\x80\\x9cGood night, Mr. Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!â\\x80\\x9d  Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar, bearing down upon them, too.     CHAPTER VII. Monseigneur in Town   Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his morningâ\\x80\\x99s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook.  Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneurâ\\x80\\x99s lips. One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function; a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.  Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.  Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: â\\x80\\x9cThe earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.â\\x80\\x9d  Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General, poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.  A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.  For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have been anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship; civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives; all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty.  The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the Future, for Monseigneurâ\\x80\\x99s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a jargon about â\\x80\\x9cthe Centre of Truth:â\\x80\\x9d holding that Man had got out of the Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre, by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never became manifest.  But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his devouring hunger far away.  Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate â\\x80\\x9cfrizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and white silk stockings.â\\x80\\x9d At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at Monseigneurâ\\x80\\x99s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!  Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it.  Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites, and was seen no more.  The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm, and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out.  â\\x80\\x9cI devote you,â\\x80\\x9d said this person, stopping at the last door on his way, and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, â\\x80\\x9cto the Devil!â\\x80\\x9d  With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.  He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one.  Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could.  With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.  But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at the horsesâ\\x80\\x99 bridles.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat has gone wrong?â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur, calmly looking out.  A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.  â\\x80\\x9cPardon, Monsieur the Marquis!â\\x80\\x9d said a ragged and submissive man, â\\x80\\x9cit is a child.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.â\\x80\\x9d  The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.  â\\x80\\x9cKilled!â\\x80\\x9d shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. â\\x80\\x9cDead!â\\x80\\x9d  The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.  He took out his purse.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is extraordinary to me,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give him that.â\\x80\\x9d  He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, â\\x80\\x9cDead!â\\x80\\x9d  He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They were as silent, however, as the men.  â\\x80\\x9cI know all, I know all,â\\x80\\x9d said the last comer. â\\x80\\x9cBe a brave man, my Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as happily?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are a philosopher, you there,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cHow do they call you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey call me Defarge.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOf what trade?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, throwing him another gold coin, â\\x80\\x9cand spend it as you will. The horses there; are they right?â\\x80\\x9d  Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.  â\\x80\\x9cHold!â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur the Marquis. â\\x80\\x9cHold the horses! Who threw that?â\\x80\\x9d  He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.  â\\x80\\x9cYou dogs!â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: â\\x80\\x9cI would ride over any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he should be crushed under the wheels.â\\x80\\x9d  So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one. But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word â\\x80\\x9cGo on!â\\x80\\x9d  He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course.     CHAPTER VIII. Monseigneur in the Country   A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant. Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.  Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting sun.  The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. â\\x80\\x9cIt will die out,â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, â\\x80\\x9cdirectly.â\\x80\\x9d  In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow left when the drag was taken off.  But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near home.  The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.  Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women, their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.  Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilionsâ\\x80\\x99 whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him. He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years.  Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group.  â\\x80\\x9cBring me hither that fellow!â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis to the courier.  The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.  â\\x80\\x9cI passed you on the road?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cComing up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, it is true.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat did you look at, so fixedly?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, I looked at the man.â\\x80\\x9d  He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat man, pig? And why look there?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWho?â\\x80\\x9d demanded the traveller.  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, the man.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMay the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYour clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSwinging by the chain? To be suffocated?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWith your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur. His head hanging over--like this!â\\x80\\x9d  He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat was he like?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!â\\x80\\x9d  The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience.  â\\x80\\x9cTruly, you did well,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, â\\x80\\x9cto see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!â\\x80\\x9d  Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner.  â\\x80\\x9cBah! Go aside!â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur Gabelle.  â\\x80\\x9cLay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDid he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?â\\x80\\x9d  The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.  â\\x80\\x9cDid the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as a person plunges into the river.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSee to it, Gabelle. Go on!â\\x80\\x9d  The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they might not have been so fortunate.  The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually, it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.  At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was dreadfully spare and thin.  To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.â\\x80\\x9d  With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face, Monseigneur looked out.  â\\x80\\x9cHow, then! What is it? Always petitions!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He cannot pay something?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAlas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor grass.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAgain, well?â\\x80\\x9d  She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch.  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAgain, well? Can I feed them?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, the good God knows; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t ask it. My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husbandâ\\x80\\x99s name, may be placed over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur! Monseigneur!â\\x80\\x9d  The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau.  The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished.  The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door of his chateau was opened to him.  â\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, not yet.â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER IX. The Gorgonâ\\x80\\x99s Head   It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions. As if the Gorgonâ\\x80\\x99s head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago.  Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in the open night-air. Other sound than the owlâ\\x80\\x99s voice there was none, save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.  The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord was angry.  Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night, Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country. The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture; but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France.  A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round room, in one of the chateauâ\\x80\\x99s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.  â\\x80\\x9cMy nephew,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; â\\x80\\x9cthey said he was not arrived.â\\x80\\x9d  Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.  â\\x80\\x9cAh! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.â\\x80\\x9d  In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his lips, when he put it down.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is that?â\\x80\\x9d he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour.  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur? That?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOutside the blinds. Open the blinds.â\\x80\\x9d  It was done.  â\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMonseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are here.â\\x80\\x9d  The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round for instructions.  â\\x80\\x9cGood,â\\x80\\x9d said the imperturbable master. â\\x80\\x9cClose them again.â\\x80\\x9d  That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand, hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the front of the chateau.  â\\x80\\x9cAsk who is arrived.â\\x80\\x9d  It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road. He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.  He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came. He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.  Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake hands.  â\\x80\\x9cYou left Paris yesterday, sir?â\\x80\\x9d he said to Monseigneur, as he took his seat at table.  â\\x80\\x9cYesterday. And you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI come direct.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFrom London?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou have been a long time coming,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, with a smile.  â\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary; I come direct.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time intending the journey.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have been detained byâ\\x80\\x9d--the nephew stopped a moment in his answer--â\\x80\\x9cvarious business.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWithout doubt,â\\x80\\x9d said the polished uncle.  So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them. When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask, opened a conversation.  â\\x80\\x9cI have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot to death,â\\x80\\x9d said the uncle; â\\x80\\x9cit is not necessary to say, to death.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI doubt, sir,â\\x80\\x9d returned the nephew, â\\x80\\x9cwhether, if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.â\\x80\\x9d  The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring.  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, sir,â\\x80\\x9d pursued the nephew, â\\x80\\x9cfor anything I know, you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no,â\\x80\\x9d said the uncle, pleasantly.  â\\x80\\x9cBut, however that may be,â\\x80\\x9d resumed the nephew, glancing at him with deep distrust, â\\x80\\x9cI know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means, and would know no scruple as to means.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy friend, I told you so,â\\x80\\x9d said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the two marks. â\\x80\\x9cDo me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI recall it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.  His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument.  â\\x80\\x9cIn effect, sir,â\\x80\\x9d pursued the nephew, â\\x80\\x9cI believe it to be at once your bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in France here.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do not quite understand,â\\x80\\x9d returned the uncle, sipping his coffee. â\\x80\\x9cDare I ask you to explain?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is possible,â\\x80\\x9d said the uncle, with great calmness. â\\x80\\x9cFor the honour of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent. Pray excuse me!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,â\\x80\\x9d observed the nephew.  â\\x80\\x9cI would not say happily, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d returned the uncle, with refined politeness; â\\x80\\x9cI would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say, at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very bad!â\\x80\\x9d  The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head; as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself, that great means of regeneration.  â\\x80\\x9cWe have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern time also,â\\x80\\x9d said the nephew, gloomily, â\\x80\\x9cthat I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLet us hope so,â\\x80\\x9d said the uncle. â\\x80\\x9cDetestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere is not,â\\x80\\x9d pursued the nephew, in his former tone, â\\x80\\x9ca face I can look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA compliment,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, â\\x80\\x9cto the grandeur of the family, merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur. Hah!â\\x80\\x9d And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his legs.  But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearerâ\\x80\\x99s assumption of indifference.  â\\x80\\x9cRepression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d observed the Marquis, â\\x80\\x9cwill keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,â\\x80\\x9d looking up to it, â\\x80\\x9cshuts out the sky.â\\x80\\x9d  That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.  â\\x80\\x9cMeanwhile,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, â\\x80\\x9cI will preserve the honour and repose of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we terminate our conference for the night?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA moment more.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAn hour, if you please.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d said the nephew, â\\x80\\x9cwe have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits of wrong.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_We_ have done wrong?â\\x80\\x9d repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile, and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.  â\\x80\\x9cOur family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s time, we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s time, when it is equally yours? Can I separate my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s twin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDeath has done that!â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd has left me,â\\x80\\x9d answered the nephew, â\\x80\\x9cbound to a system that is frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute the last request of my dear motherâ\\x80\\x99s lips, and obey the last look of my dear motherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSeeking them from me, my nephew,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, touching him on the breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--â\\x80\\x9cyou will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.â\\x80\\x9d  Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the body, and said,  â\\x80\\x9cMy friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have lived.â\\x80\\x9d  When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his box in his pocket.  â\\x80\\x9cBetter to be a rational creature,â\\x80\\x9d he added then, after ringing a small bell on the table, â\\x80\\x9cand accept your natural destiny. But you are lost, Monsieur Charles, I see.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThis property and France are lost to me,â\\x80\\x9d said the nephew, sadly; â\\x80\\x9cI renounce them.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAre they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed to me from you, to-morrow--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhich I have the vanity to hope is not probable.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c--or twenty years hence--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou do me too much honour,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis; â\\x80\\x9cstill, I prefer that supposition.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHah!â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.  â\\x80\\x9cTo the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHah!â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.  â\\x80\\x9cIf it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse on it, and on all this land.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd you?â\\x80\\x9d said the uncle. â\\x80\\x9cForgive my curiosity; do you, under your new philosophy, graciously intend to live?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some day--work.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIn England, for example?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.â\\x80\\x9d  The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his valet.  â\\x80\\x9cEngland is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have prospered there,â\\x80\\x9d he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile.  â\\x80\\x9cI have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWith a daughter?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said the Marquis. â\\x80\\x9cYou are fatigued. Good night!â\\x80\\x9d  As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words, which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic.  â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d repeated the Marquis. â\\x80\\x9cA Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!â\\x80\\x9d  It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.  â\\x80\\x9cGood night!â\\x80\\x9d said the uncle. â\\x80\\x9cI look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,â\\x80\\x9d he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom.  The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on.  He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the dayâ\\x80\\x99s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain, the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the tall man with his arms up, crying, â\\x80\\x9cDead!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am cool now,â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur the Marquis, â\\x80\\x9cand may go to bed.â\\x80\\x9d  So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.  The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them.  For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape, dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads. The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village, taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.  The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.  Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might. At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.  Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot.  The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.  All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?  What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his dayâ\\x80\\x99s dinner (not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crowâ\\x80\\x99s while to peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the fountain.  All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora?  It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.  The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years.  It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:  â\\x80\\x9cDrive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER X. Two Promises   More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a tutor, whose attainments made the studentâ\\x80\\x99s way unusually pleasant and profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest. So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.  In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.  A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in London.  Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has invariably gone one way--Charles Darnayâ\\x80\\x99s way--the way of the love of a woman.  He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.  That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.  He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.  He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.  â\\x80\\x9cCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,â\\x80\\x9d he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. â\\x80\\x9cMiss Manette--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs well,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, as he stopped short, â\\x80\\x9cand your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.â\\x80\\x9d  There was a blank silence.  â\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. â\\x80\\x9cBring your chair here, and speak on.â\\x80\\x9d  He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy.  â\\x80\\x9cI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,â\\x80\\x9d  so he at length began, â\\x80\\x9cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--â\\x80\\x9d  He was stayed by the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s putting out his hand to stop him. When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:  â\\x80\\x9cIs Lucie the topic?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShe is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!â\\x80\\x9d he said deferentially.  There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:  â\\x80\\x9cI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.â\\x80\\x9d  His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated.  â\\x80\\x9cShall I go on, sir?â\\x80\\x9d  Another blank.  â\\x80\\x9cYes, go on.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!â\\x80\\x9d  The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried:  â\\x80\\x9cNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!â\\x80\\x9d  His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnayâ\\x80\\x99s ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter so received it, and remained silent.  â\\x80\\x9cI ask your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. â\\x80\\x9cI do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.â\\x80\\x9d  He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face:  â\\x80\\x9cHave you spoken to Lucie?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNor written?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNever.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks you.â\\x80\\x9d  He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.  â\\x80\\x9cI know,â\\x80\\x9d said Darnay, respectfully, â\\x80\\x9chow can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.â\\x80\\x9d  Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.  â\\x80\\x9cDear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her. Heaven is my witness that I love her!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI believe it,â\\x80\\x9d answered her father, mournfully. â\\x80\\x9cI have thought so before now. I believe it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut, do not believe,â\\x80\\x9d said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound, â\\x80\\x9cthat if my fortune were so cast as that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not now touch this honoured hand.â\\x80\\x9d  He laid his own upon it as he spoke.  â\\x80\\x9cNo, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.â\\x80\\x9d  His touch still lingered on her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s hand. Answering the touch for a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.  â\\x80\\x9cYou speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNone. As yet, none.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you seek any guidance from me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you seek any promise from me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do seek that.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitorâ\\x80\\x99s favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason, Doctor Manette,â\\x80\\x9d said Darnay, modestly but firmly, â\\x80\\x9cI would not ask that word, to save my life.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMay I ask, sir, if you think she is--â\\x80\\x9d As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest.  â\\x80\\x9cIs sought by any other suitor?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is what I meant to say.â\\x80\\x9d  Her father considered a little before he answered:  â\\x80\\x9cYou have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOr both,â\\x80\\x9d said Darnay.  â\\x80\\x9cI had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want a promise from me. Tell me what it is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe immediately.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI give the promise,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, â\\x80\\x9cwithout any condition. I believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you. If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--â\\x80\\x9d  The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke:  â\\x80\\x9c--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.â\\x80\\x9d  So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.  â\\x80\\x9cYou said something to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. â\\x80\\x9cWhat was it you said to me?â\\x80\\x9d  He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:  â\\x80\\x9cYour confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my motherâ\\x80\\x99s, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cStop!â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor of Beauvais.  â\\x80\\x9cI wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cStop!â\\x80\\x9d  For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnayâ\\x80\\x99s lips.  â\\x80\\x9cTell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you promise?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWillingly.  â\\x80\\x9cGive me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!â\\x80\\x9d  It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his reading-chair empty.  â\\x80\\x9cMy father!â\\x80\\x9d she called to him. â\\x80\\x9cFather dear!â\\x80\\x9d  Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her blood all chilled, â\\x80\\x9cWhat shall I do! What shall I do!â\\x80\\x9d  Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down together for a long time.  She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual.     CHAPTER XI. A Companion Picture   â\\x80\\x9cSydney,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his jackal; â\\x80\\x9cmix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryverâ\\x80\\x99s papers before the setting in of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and bring grist to the mill again.  Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours.  â\\x80\\x9cAre you mixing that other bowl of punch?â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver the portly, with his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back.  â\\x80\\x9cI am.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_Do_ you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes. And not for money. What do you say now?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGuess.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo I know her?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGuess.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am not going to guess, at five oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, with my brains frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask me to dinner.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell then, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting posture. â\\x80\\x9cSydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you, because you are such an insensible dog.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd you,â\\x80\\x9d returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, â\\x80\\x9care such a sensitive and poetical spirit--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCome!â\\x80\\x9d rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, â\\x80\\x9cthough I donâ\\x80\\x99t prefer any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are a luckier, if you mean that.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSay gallantry, while you are about it,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Carton.  â\\x80\\x9cWell! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, â\\x80\\x9cwho cares more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how to be agreeable, in a womanâ\\x80\\x99s society, than you do.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGo on,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney Carton.  â\\x80\\x9cNo; but before I go on,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying way, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll have this out with you. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve been at Doctor Manetteâ\\x80\\x99s house as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you, Sydney!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything,â\\x80\\x9d returned Sydney; â\\x80\\x9cyou ought to be much obliged to me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou shall not get off in that way,â\\x80\\x9d rejoined Stryver, shouldering the rejoinder at him; â\\x80\\x9cno, Sydney, itâ\\x80\\x99s my duty to tell you--and I tell you to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.  â\\x80\\x9cLook at me!â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, squaring himself; â\\x80\\x9cI have less need to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances. Why do I do it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI never saw you do it yet,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Carton.  â\\x80\\x9cI do it because itâ\\x80\\x99s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I get on.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,â\\x80\\x9d  answered Carton, with a careless air; â\\x80\\x9cI wish you would keep to that. As to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?â\\x80\\x9d  He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.  â\\x80\\x9cYou have no business to be incorrigible,â\\x80\\x9d was his friendâ\\x80\\x99s answer, delivered in no very soothing tone.  â\\x80\\x9cI have no business to be, at all, that I know of,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney Carton. â\\x80\\x9cWho is the lady?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow, donâ\\x80\\x99t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, â\\x80\\x9cbecause I know you donâ\\x80\\x99t mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI did?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCertainly; and in these chambers.â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.  â\\x80\\x9cYou made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not. You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a manâ\\x80\\x99s opinion of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music of mine, who had no ear for music.â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers, looking at his friend.  â\\x80\\x9cNow you know all about it, Syd,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t care about fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man, and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?â\\x80\\x9d  Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, â\\x80\\x9cWhy should I be astonished?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou approve?â\\x80\\x9d  Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, â\\x80\\x9cWhy should I not approve?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell!â\\x80\\x9d said his friend Stryver, â\\x80\\x9cyou take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it (when he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t, he can stay away), and I feel that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you know; you really are in a bad way. You donâ\\x80\\x99t know the value of money, you live hard, youâ\\x80\\x99ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you really ought to think about a nurse.â\\x80\\x9d  The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.  â\\x80\\x9cNow, let me recommend you,â\\x80\\x9d pursued Stryver, â\\x80\\x9cto look it in the face. I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face, you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of womenâ\\x80\\x99s society, nor understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way, or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the kind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll think of it,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney.     CHAPTER XII. The Fellow of Delicacy   Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it and Hilary.  As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer case could be.  Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.  Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple, while the bloom of the Long Vacationâ\\x80\\x99s infancy was still upon it. Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet on Saint Dunstanâ\\x80\\x99s side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have seen how safe and strong he was.  His way taking him past Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, and he both banking at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr. Stryverâ\\x80\\x99s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything under the clouds were a sum.  â\\x80\\x9cHalloa!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver. â\\x80\\x9cHow do you do? I hope you are well!â\\x80\\x9d  It was Stryverâ\\x80\\x99s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.  The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances, â\\x80\\x9cHow do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do you do, sir?â\\x80\\x9d and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.  â\\x80\\x9cCan I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Lorry, in his business character.  â\\x80\\x9cWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh indeed!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off.  â\\x80\\x9cI am going,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: â\\x80\\x9cI am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh dear me!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously.  â\\x80\\x9cOh dear me, sir?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Stryver, drawing back. â\\x80\\x9cOh dear you, sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy meaning,â\\x80\\x9d answered the man of business, â\\x80\\x9cis, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr. Stryver--â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, â\\x80\\x9cyou know there really is so much too much of you!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell!â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, â\\x80\\x9cif I understand you, Mr. Lorry, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be hanged!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen.  â\\x80\\x9cD--n it all, sir!â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, staring at him, â\\x80\\x9cam I not eligible?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, youâ\\x80\\x99re eligible!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cIf you say eligible, you are eligible.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAm I not prosperous?â\\x80\\x9d asked Stryver.  â\\x80\\x9cOh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd advancing?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf you come to advancing you know,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, â\\x80\\x9cnobody can doubt that.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen.  â\\x80\\x9cWell! I--Were you going there now?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cStraight!â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.  â\\x80\\x9cThen I think I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, if I was you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver. â\\x80\\x9cNow, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll put you in a corner,â\\x80\\x9d forensically shaking a forefinger at him. â\\x80\\x9cYou are a man of business and bound to have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you go?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBecause,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cD--n _me_!â\\x80\\x9d cried Stryver, â\\x80\\x9cbut this beats everything.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry Stryver.  â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_ a Bank,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver; â\\x80\\x9cand having summed up three leading reasons for complete success, he says thereâ\\x80\\x99s no reason at all! Says it with his head on!â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young lady, my good sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, â\\x80\\x9cthe young lady. The young lady goes before all.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, squaring his elbows, â\\x80\\x9cthat it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, reddening, â\\x80\\x9cthat I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk, not even Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind.â\\x80\\x9d  The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryverâ\\x80\\x99s blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry; Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in no better state now it was his turn.  â\\x80\\x9cThat is what I mean to tell you, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cPray let there be no mistake about it.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:  â\\x80\\x9cThis is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the Kingâ\\x80\\x99s Bench bar?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, I do.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cVery good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd all I can say of it is,â\\x80\\x9d laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, â\\x80\\x9cthat this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow understand me,â\\x80\\x9d pursued Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cAs a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I may not be right?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot I!â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, whistling. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. Itâ\\x80\\x99s new to me, but you are right, I dare say.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And understand me, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, â\\x80\\x9cI will not--not even at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s--have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere! I beg your pardon!â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver.  â\\x80\\x9cGranted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared. What do you say?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow long would you keep me in town?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen I say yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver: â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look in to-night. Good morning.â\\x80\\x9d  Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in.  The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow, he got it down. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver, shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, â\\x80\\x9cmy way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.â\\x80\\x9d  It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found great relief. â\\x80\\x9cYou shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Stryver; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll do that for you.â\\x80\\x9d  Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.  â\\x80\\x9cWell!â\\x80\\x9d said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. â\\x80\\x9cI have been to Soho.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTo Soho?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. â\\x80\\x9cOh, to be sure! What am I thinking of!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd I have no doubt,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cthat I was right in the conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI assure you,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, â\\x80\\x9cthat I am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor fatherâ\\x80\\x99s account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let us say no more about it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand you,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cI dare say not,â\\x80\\x9d rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and final way; â\\x80\\x9cno matter, no matter.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut it does matter,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry urged.  â\\x80\\x9cNo it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t; I assure you it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t. Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account. And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do; you were right, it never would have done.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr. Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head. â\\x80\\x9cMake the best of it, my dear sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver; â\\x80\\x9csay no more about it; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.     CHAPTER XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy   If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year, and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely pierced by the light within him.  And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that neighbourhood.  On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal that â\\x80\\x9che had thought better of that marrying matterâ\\x80\\x9d) had carried his delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydneyâ\\x80\\x99s feet still trod those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him to the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s door.  He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed a change in it.  â\\x80\\x9cI fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to live no better life?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGod knows it is a shame!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen why not change it?â\\x80\\x9d  Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he answered:  â\\x80\\x9cIt is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall sink lower, and be worse.â\\x80\\x9d  He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The table trembled in the silence that followed.  She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to be so, without looking at her, and said:  â\\x80\\x9cPray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier, it would make me very glad!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGod bless you for your sweet compassion!â\\x80\\x9d  He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid to hear me. Donâ\\x80\\x99t shrink from anything I say. I am like one who died young. All my life might have been.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSay of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget it!â\\x80\\x9d  She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden.  â\\x80\\x9cIf it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot be.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWithout it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your confidence? I know this is a confidence,â\\x80\\x9d she modestly said, after a little hesitation, and in earnest tears, â\\x80\\x9cI know you would say this to no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?â\\x80\\x9d  He shook his head.  â\\x80\\x9cTo none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWill nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no service, idly burning away.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSince it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSince the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for good, with you, at all?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhich I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEntreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself, and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there alone, and will be shared by no one?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf that will be a consolation to you, yes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Carton,â\\x80\\x9d she answered, after an agitated pause, â\\x80\\x9cthe secret is yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThank you. And again, God bless you.â\\x80\\x9d  He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.  â\\x80\\x9cBe under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!â\\x80\\x9d  He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her.  â\\x80\\x9cBe comforted!â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cI am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this of me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI will, Mr. Carton.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy fatherâ\\x80\\x99s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!â\\x80\\x9d  He said, â\\x80\\x9cFarewell!â\\x80\\x9d said a last â\\x80\\x9cGod bless you!â\\x80\\x9d and left her.     CHAPTER XIV. The Honest Tradesman   To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down!  With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.  Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.  It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs. Cruncher must have been â\\x80\\x9cfloppingâ\\x80\\x9d in some pointed manner, when an unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this funeral, which engendered uproar.  â\\x80\\x9cYoung Jerry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a buryinâ\\x80\\x99.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHooroar, father!â\\x80\\x9d cried Young Jerry.  The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat dâ\\x80\\x99ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for _me_!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. â\\x80\\x9cHim and his hooroars! Donâ\\x80\\x99t let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. Dâ\\x80\\x99ye hear?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI warnâ\\x80\\x99t doing no harm,â\\x80\\x9d Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.  â\\x80\\x9cDrop it then,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher; â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t have none of _your_ no harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.â\\x80\\x9d  His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and incessantly groaning and calling out: â\\x80\\x9cYah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!â\\x80\\x9d  with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.  Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, brother? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s it about?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_I_ donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d said the man. â\\x80\\x9cSpies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!â\\x80\\x9d  He asked another man. â\\x80\\x9cWho is it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_I_ donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, â\\x80\\x9cSpies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!â\\x80\\x9d  At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly.  â\\x80\\x9cWas he a spy?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Cruncher.  â\\x80\\x9cOld Bailey spy,â\\x80\\x9d returned his informant. â\\x80\\x9cYaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey Spi--i--ies!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy, to be sure!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had assisted. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen him. Dead, is he?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDead as mutton,â\\x80\\x9d returned the other, â\\x80\\x9cand canâ\\x80\\x99t be too dead. Have â\\x80\\x99em out, there! Spies! Pull â\\x80\\x99em out, there! Spies!â\\x80\\x9d  The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have â\\x80\\x99em out, and to pull â\\x80\\x99em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowdâ\\x80\\x99s opening the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears.  These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded. They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out, while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, in the further corner of the mourning coach.  The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief. The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked.  Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction.  The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual progress of a mob.  Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers. The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot.  â\\x80\\x9cJerry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way, â\\x80\\x9cyou see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he was a young â\\x80\\x99un and a straight made â\\x80\\x99un.â\\x80\\x9d  Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his station at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.  Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.  â\\x80\\x9cNow, I tell you where it is!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on entering. â\\x80\\x9cIf, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I shall make sure that youâ\\x80\\x99ve been praying again me, and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it.â\\x80\\x9d  The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.  â\\x80\\x9cWhy, youâ\\x80\\x99re at it afore my face!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of angry apprehension.  â\\x80\\x9cI am saying nothing.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell, then; donâ\\x80\\x99t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate. You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, Jerry.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, Jerry,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. â\\x80\\x9cAh! It _is_ yes, Jerry. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction.  â\\x80\\x9cYou and your yes, Jerry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer. â\\x80\\x9cAh! I think so. I believe you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are going out to-night?â\\x80\\x9d asked his decent wife, when he took another bite.  â\\x80\\x9cYes, I am.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMay I go with you, father?â\\x80\\x9d asked his son, briskly.  â\\x80\\x9cNo, you maynâ\\x80\\x99t. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s where Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to. Going a fishing.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYour fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; donâ\\x80\\x99t it, father?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNever you mind.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShall you bring any fish home, father?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf I donâ\\x80\\x99t, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have short commons, to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d returned that gentleman, shaking his head; â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s questions enough for you; I ainâ\\x80\\x99t a going out, till youâ\\x80\\x99ve been long abed.â\\x80\\x9d  He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd mind you!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher. â\\x80\\x9cNo games to-morrow! If I, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly customer to you, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t. _I_â\\x80\\x99m your Rome, you know.â\\x80\\x9d  Then he began grumbling again:  â\\x80\\x9cWith your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how scarce you maynâ\\x80\\x99t make the wittles and drink here, by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_ yourâ\\x80\\x99n, ainâ\\x80\\x99t he? Heâ\\x80\\x99s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother, and not know that a motherâ\\x80\\x99s first duty is to blow her boy out?â\\x80\\x9d  This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.  Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions, obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one oâ\\x80\\x99clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher, extinguished the light, and went out.  Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door stood ajar all night.  Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts, walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.  Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split himself into two.  The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate. He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands and knees.  It was now Young Jerryâ\\x80\\x99s turn to approach the gate: which he did, holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass! and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to fish.  They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew. Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his hair as stiff as his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s.  But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.  He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boyâ\\x80\\x99s kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep.  From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed.  â\\x80\\x9cI told you I would,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, â\\x80\\x9cand I did.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJerry, Jerry, Jerry!â\\x80\\x9d his wife implored.  â\\x80\\x9cYou oppose yourself to the profit of the business,â\\x80\\x9d said Jerry, â\\x80\\x9cand me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI try to be a good wife, Jerry,â\\x80\\x9d the poor woman protested, with tears.  â\\x80\\x9cIs it being a good wife to oppose your husbandâ\\x80\\x99s business? Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou hadnâ\\x80\\x99t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s enough for you,â\\x80\\x9d retorted Mr. Cruncher, â\\x80\\x9cto be the wife of a honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didnâ\\x80\\x99t. A honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious woman? If youâ\\x80\\x99re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have no more natâ\\x80\\x99ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.â\\x80\\x9d  The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in the honest tradesmanâ\\x80\\x99s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay down too, and fell asleep again.  There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling.  Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning.  â\\x80\\x9cFather,â\\x80\\x9d said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at armâ\\x80\\x99s length and to have the stool well between them: â\\x80\\x9cwhatâ\\x80\\x99s a Resurrection-Man?â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, â\\x80\\x9cHow should I know?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI thought you knowed everything, father,â\\x80\\x9d said the artless boy.  â\\x80\\x9cHem! Well,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s a tradesman.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s his goods, father?â\\x80\\x9d asked the brisk Young Jerry.  â\\x80\\x9cHis goods,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, â\\x80\\x9cis a branch of Scientific goods.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPersonsâ\\x80\\x99 bodies, ainâ\\x80\\x99t it, father?â\\x80\\x9d asked the lively boy.  â\\x80\\x9cI believe it is something of that sort,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher.  â\\x80\\x9cOh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when Iâ\\x80\\x99m quite growed up!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. â\\x80\\x9cIt depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.â\\x80\\x9d As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: â\\x80\\x9cJerry, you honest tradesman, thereâ\\x80\\x99s hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER XV. Knitting   There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it.  This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks.  Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.  A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the kingâ\\x80\\x99s palace to the criminalâ\\x80\\x99s gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off.  Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.  â\\x80\\x9cGood day, gentlemen!â\\x80\\x9d said Monsieur Defarge.  It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited an answering chorus of â\\x80\\x9cGood day!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is bad weather, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, shaking his head.  Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.  â\\x80\\x9cMy wife,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: â\\x80\\x9cI have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and halfâ\\x80\\x99s journey out of Paris. He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to drink, my wife!â\\x80\\x9d  A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s counter. A third man got up and went out.  Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast. He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.  â\\x80\\x9cHave you finished your repast, friend?â\\x80\\x9d he asked, in due season.  â\\x80\\x9cYes, thank you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCome, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.â\\x80\\x9d  Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.  No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall.  Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:  â\\x80\\x9cJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!â\\x80\\x9d  The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, â\\x80\\x9cWhere shall I commence, monsieur?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCommence,â\\x80\\x9d was Monsieur Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s not unreasonable reply, â\\x80\\x9cat the commencement.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI saw him then, messieurs,â\\x80\\x9d began the mender of roads, â\\x80\\x9ca year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.â\\x80\\x9d  Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.  Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?  â\\x80\\x9cNever,â\\x80\\x9d answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.  Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?  â\\x80\\x9cBy his tall figure,â\\x80\\x9d said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose. â\\x80\\x9cWhen Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, â\\x80\\x98Say, what is he like?â\\x80\\x99 I make response, â\\x80\\x98Tall as a spectre.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou should have said, short as a dwarf,â\\x80\\x9d returned Jacques Two.  â\\x80\\x9cBut what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, â\\x80\\x98To me! Bring that rascal!â\\x80\\x99 My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe is right there, Jacques,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted. â\\x80\\x9cGo on!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGood!â\\x80\\x9d said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. â\\x80\\x9cThe tall man is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo matter, the number,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cHe is well hidden, but at last he is unluckily found. Go on!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!â\\x80\\x9d  With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.  â\\x80\\x9cI stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants. Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!â\\x80\\x9d  He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.  â\\x80\\x9cI do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with our eyes. â\\x80\\x98Come on!â\\x80\\x99 says the chief of that company, pointing to the village, â\\x80\\x98bring him fast to his tomb!â\\x80\\x99 and they bring him faster. I follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!â\\x80\\x9d  He imitated the action of a manâ\\x80\\x99s being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets.  â\\x80\\x9cAs they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!â\\x80\\x9d  He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again, Defarge said, â\\x80\\x9cGo on, Jacques.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAll the village,â\\x80\\x9d pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low voice, â\\x80\\x9cwithdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it, except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a dead man.â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the countrymanâ\\x80\\x99s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to him.  â\\x80\\x9cGo on, Jacques,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cHe remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know? It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cListen then, Jacques,â\\x80\\x9d Number One of that name sternly interposed. â\\x80\\x9cKnow that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in his hand.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd once again listen, Jacques!â\\x80\\x9d said the kneeling Number Three: his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither food nor drink; â\\x80\\x9cthe guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him blows. You hear?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI hear, messieurs.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGo on then,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cAgain; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,â\\x80\\x9d resumed the countryman, â\\x80\\x9cthat he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies? I am not a scholar.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cListen once again then, Jacques!â\\x80\\x9d said the man with the restless hand and the craving air. â\\x80\\x9cThe name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall, when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was done--why, how old are you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThirty-five,â\\x80\\x9d said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEnough!â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, with grim impatience. â\\x80\\x9cLong live the Devil! Go on.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water.â\\x80\\x9d  The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling, and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.  â\\x80\\x9cAll work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out, the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he laughed.â\\x80\\x9d He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners of his mouth to his ears. â\\x80\\x9cOn the top of the gallows is fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.â\\x80\\x9d  They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church, across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!â\\x80\\x9d  The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do), and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here you see me!â\\x80\\x9d  After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, â\\x80\\x9cGood! You have acted and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the door?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cVery willingly,â\\x80\\x9d said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.  The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to the garret.  â\\x80\\x9cHow say you, Jacques?â\\x80\\x9d demanded Number One. â\\x80\\x9cTo be registered?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTo be registered, as doomed to destruction,â\\x80\\x9d returned Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cMagnificent!â\\x80\\x9d croaked the man with the craving.  â\\x80\\x9cThe chateau, and all the race?â\\x80\\x9d inquired the first.  â\\x80\\x9cThe chateau and all the race,â\\x80\\x9d returned Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cExtermination.â\\x80\\x9d  The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, â\\x80\\x9cMagnificent!â\\x80\\x9d and began gnawing another finger.  â\\x80\\x9cAre you sure,â\\x80\\x9d asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, â\\x80\\x9cthat no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJacques,â\\x80\\x9d returned Defarge, drawing himself up, â\\x80\\x9cif madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives, to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.â\\x80\\x9d  There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who hungered, asked: â\\x80\\x9cIs this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe knows nothing,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge; â\\x80\\x9cat least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and Court; let him see them on Sunday.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the hungry man, staring. â\\x80\\x9cIs it a good sign, that he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJacques,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge; â\\x80\\x9cjudiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish him to bring it down one day.â\\x80\\x9d  Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon asleep.  Worse quarters than Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s wine-shop, could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out.  Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen.  â\\x80\\x9cYou work hard, madame,â\\x80\\x9d said a man near her.  â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d answered Madame Defarge; â\\x80\\x9cI have a good deal to do.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you make, madame?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMany things.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFor instance--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFor instance,â\\x80\\x9d returned Madame Defarge, composedly, â\\x80\\x9cshrouds.â\\x80\\x9d  The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the shining Bullâ\\x80\\x99s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bullâ\\x80\\x99s Eye, more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.  â\\x80\\x9cBravo!â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a patron; â\\x80\\x9cyou are a good boy!â\\x80\\x9d  The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.  â\\x80\\x9cYou are the fellow we want,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, in his ear; â\\x80\\x9cyou make these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more insolent, and it is the nearer ended.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHey!â\\x80\\x9d cried the mender of roads, reflectively; â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s true.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThese fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot deceive them too much.â\\x80\\x9d  Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in confirmation.  â\\x80\\x9cAs to you,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cyou would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTruly, madame, I think so. For the moment.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTruly yes, madame.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage, you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is true, madame.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou have seen both dolls and birds to-day,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent; â\\x80\\x9cnow, go home!â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER XVI. Still Knitting   Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there.  Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.  The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight, in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate with, and affectionately embraced.  When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings, and they, having finally alighted near the Saintâ\\x80\\x99s boundaries, were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:  â\\x80\\x9cSay then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cVery little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he can say, but he knows of one.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEh well!â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool business air. â\\x80\\x9cIt is necessary to register him. How do they call that man?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe is English.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSo much the better. His name?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBarsad,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect correctness.  â\\x80\\x9cBarsad,â\\x80\\x9d repeated madame. â\\x80\\x9cGood. Christian name?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJohn.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJohn Barsad,â\\x80\\x9d repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself. â\\x80\\x9cGood. His appearance; is it known?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAge, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEh my faith. It is a portrait!â\\x80\\x9d said madame, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cHe shall be registered to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d  They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight), and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he walked up and down through life.  The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s olfactory sense was by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.  â\\x80\\x9cYou are fatigued,â\\x80\\x9d said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the money. â\\x80\\x9cThere are only the usual odours.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am a little tired,â\\x80\\x9d her husband acknowledged.  â\\x80\\x9cYou are a little depressed, too,â\\x80\\x9d said madame, whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for him. â\\x80\\x9cOh, the men, the men!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut my dear!â\\x80\\x9d began Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cBut my dear!â\\x80\\x9d repeated madame, nodding firmly; â\\x80\\x9cbut my dear! You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his breast, â\\x80\\x9cit _is_ a long time.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is a long time,â\\x80\\x9d repeated his wife; â\\x80\\x9cand when is it not a long time? Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cHow long,â\\x80\\x9d demanded madame, composedly, â\\x80\\x9cdoes it take to make and store the lightning? Tell me.â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that too.  â\\x80\\x9cIt does not take a long time,â\\x80\\x9d said madame, â\\x80\\x9cfor an earthquake to swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA long time, I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cBut when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.â\\x80\\x9d  She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.  â\\x80\\x9cI tell thee,â\\x80\\x9d said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis, â\\x80\\x9cthat although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy brave wife,â\\x80\\x9d returned Defarge, standing before her with his head a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist, â\\x80\\x9cI do not question all this. But it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife, it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEh well! How then?â\\x80\\x9d demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there were another enemy strangled.  â\\x80\\x9cWell!â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug. â\\x80\\x9cWe shall not see the triumph.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWe shall have helped it,â\\x80\\x9d returned madame, with her extended hand in strong action. â\\x80\\x9cNothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I would--â\\x80\\x9d  Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.  â\\x80\\x9cHold!â\\x80\\x9d cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice; â\\x80\\x9cI too, my dear, will stop at nothing.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that. When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.â\\x80\\x9d  Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.  Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot, and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.  A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.  It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop.  â\\x80\\x9cGood day, madame,â\\x80\\x9d said the new-comer.  â\\x80\\x9cGood day, monsieur.â\\x80\\x9d  She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting: â\\x80\\x9cHah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression! Good day, one and all!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.â\\x80\\x9d  Madame complied with a polite air.  â\\x80\\x9cMarvellous cognac this, madame!â\\x80\\x9d  It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general.  â\\x80\\x9cYou knit with great skill, madame.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am accustomed to it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA pretty pattern too!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_You_ think so?â\\x80\\x9d said madame, looking at him with a smile.  â\\x80\\x9cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPastime,â\\x80\\x9d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly.  â\\x80\\x9cNot for use?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,â\\x80\\x9d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll use it!â\\x80\\x9d  It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable.  â\\x80\\x9c_John_,â\\x80\\x9d thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger. â\\x80\\x9cStay long enough, and I shall knit â\\x80\\x98BARSADâ\\x80\\x99 before you go.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou have a husband, madame?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cChildren?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo children.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBusiness seems bad?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBusiness is very bad; the people are so poor.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAs _you_ say,â\\x80\\x9d madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good.  â\\x80\\x9cPardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. Of course.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c_I_ think?â\\x80\\x9d returned madame, in a high voice. â\\x80\\x9cI and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.â\\x80\\x9d  The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.  â\\x80\\x9cA bad business this, madame, of Gaspardâ\\x80\\x99s execution. Ah! the poor Gaspard!â\\x80\\x9d With a sigh of great compassion.  â\\x80\\x9cMy faith!â\\x80\\x9d returned madame, coolly and lightly, â\\x80\\x9cif people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI believe,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: â\\x80\\x9cI believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between ourselves.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs there?â\\x80\\x9d asked madame, vacantly.  â\\x80\\x9cIs there not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c--Here is my husband!â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge.  As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, â\\x80\\x9cGood day, Jacques!â\\x80\\x9d Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.  â\\x80\\x9cGood day, Jacques!â\\x80\\x9d the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.  â\\x80\\x9cYou deceive yourself, monsieur,â\\x80\\x9d returned the keeper of the wine-shop. â\\x80\\x9cYou mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is all the same,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: â\\x80\\x9cgood day!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGood day!â\\x80\\x9d answered Defarge, drily.  â\\x80\\x9cI was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo one has told me so,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, shaking his head. â\\x80\\x9cI know nothing of it.â\\x80\\x9d  Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his hand on the back of his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s chair, looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction.  The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it.  â\\x80\\x9cYou seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?â\\x80\\x9d  observed Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cNot at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHah!â\\x80\\x9d muttered Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cThe pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,â\\x80\\x9d  pursued the spy, â\\x80\\x9cthat I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed!â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, with much indifference.  â\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic, had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am informed of the circumstances?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSuch is the fact, certainly,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge. He had had it conveyed to him, in an accidental touch of his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s elbow as she knitted and warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was to you,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy, â\\x80\\x9cthat his daughter came; and it was from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of Tellson and Company--over to England.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSuch is the fact,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cVery interesting remembrances!â\\x80\\x9d said the spy. â\\x80\\x9cI have known Doctor Manette and his daughter, in England.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t hear much about them now?â\\x80\\x9d said the spy.  â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cIn effect,â\\x80\\x9d madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little song, â\\x80\\x9cwe never hear about them. We received the news of their safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then, they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held no correspondence.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPerfectly so, madame,â\\x80\\x9d replied the spy. â\\x80\\x9cShe is going to be married.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGoing?â\\x80\\x9d echoed madame. â\\x80\\x9cShe was pretty enough to have been married long ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh! You know I am English.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI perceive your tongue is,â\\x80\\x9d returned madame; â\\x80\\x9cand what the tongue is, I suppose the man is.â\\x80\\x9d  He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the end, he added:  â\\x80\\x9cYes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay. Dâ\\x80\\x99Aulnais is the name of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s family.â\\x80\\x9d  Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter, as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.  Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should come back.  â\\x80\\x9cCan it be true,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: â\\x80\\x9cwhat he has said of Maâ\\x80\\x99amselle Manette?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAs he has said it,â\\x80\\x9d returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, â\\x80\\x9cit is probably false. But it may be true.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf it is--â\\x80\\x9d Defarge began, and stopped.  â\\x80\\x9cIf it is?â\\x80\\x9d repeated his wife.  â\\x80\\x9c--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHer husbandâ\\x80\\x99s destiny,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure, â\\x80\\x9cwill take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is to end him. That is all I know.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strangeâ\\x80\\x9d--said Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it, â\\x80\\x9cthat, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by the side of that infernal dogâ\\x80\\x99s who has just left us?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cStranger things than that will happen when it does come,â\\x80\\x9d answered madame. â\\x80\\x9cI have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here for their merits; that is enough.â\\x80\\x9d  She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head. Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.  In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still, the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.  But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left behind.  Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. â\\x80\\x9cA great woman,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9ca strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully grand woman!â\\x80\\x9d  Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty, Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting, counting dropping heads.     CHAPTER XVII. One Night   Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.  Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.  â\\x80\\x9cYou are happy, my dear father?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cQuite, my child.â\\x80\\x9d  They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charlesâ\\x80\\x99s love for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--â\\x80\\x9d  Even as it was, she could not command her voice.  In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face upon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and its going.  â\\x80\\x9cDearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?â\\x80\\x9d  Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed, â\\x80\\x9cQuite sure, my darling! More than that,â\\x80\\x9d he added, as he tenderly kissed her: â\\x80\\x9cmy future is far brighter, Lucie, seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever was--without it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf I could hope _that_, my father!--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBelieve it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted--â\\x80\\x9d  She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated the word.  â\\x80\\x9c--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy with you.â\\x80\\x9d  He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied:  â\\x80\\x9cMy child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.â\\x80\\x9d  It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long afterwards.  â\\x80\\x9cSee!â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon. â\\x80\\x9cI have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic, that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them.â\\x80\\x9d He added in his inward and pondering manner, as he looked at the moon, â\\x80\\x9cIt was twenty either way, I remember, and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.â\\x80\\x9d  The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time, deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.  â\\x80\\x9cI have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had been born alive, or the poor motherâ\\x80\\x99s shock had killed it. Whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it was a son who would never know his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s story; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s having disappeared of his own will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.â\\x80\\x9d  She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.  â\\x80\\x9cI have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a blank.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShe knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSo! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door. But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think? I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions.â\\x80\\x9d  His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.  â\\x80\\x9cIn that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight, coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active, cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love that was I.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd she showed me her children,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor of Beauvais, â\\x80\\x9cand they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things. But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and blessed her.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless me as fervently to-morrow?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.â\\x80\\x9d  He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the house.  There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.  Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.  So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated. But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears, beforehand.  All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his; then, leaned over him, and looked at him.  Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.  She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him.     CHAPTER XVIII. Nine Days   The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s room, where he was speaking with Charles Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd so,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; â\\x80\\x9cand so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean it,â\\x80\\x9d remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cand therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cReally? Well; but donâ\\x80\\x99t cry,â\\x80\\x9d said the gentle Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cI am not crying,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross; â\\x80\\x9c_you_ are.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI, my Pross?â\\x80\\x9d (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.)  â\\x80\\x9cYou were, just now; I saw you do it, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder at it. Such a present of plate as you have made â\\x80\\x99em, is enough to bring tears into anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s not a fork or a spoon in the collection,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cthat I didnâ\\x80\\x99t cry over, last night after the box came, till I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am highly gratified,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cthough, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot at all!â\\x80\\x9d From Miss Pross.  â\\x80\\x9cYou think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?â\\x80\\x9d asked the gentleman of that name.  â\\x80\\x9cPooh!â\\x80\\x9d rejoined Miss Pross; â\\x80\\x9cyou were a bachelor in your cradle.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell!â\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, â\\x80\\x9cthat seems probable, too.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd you were cut out for a bachelor,â\\x80\\x9d pursued Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cbefore you were put in your cradle.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen, I think,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cthat I was very unhandsomely dealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,â\\x80\\x9d drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, â\\x80\\x9cI hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at the fortnightâ\\x80\\x99s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnightâ\\x80\\x99s trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear Somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his own.â\\x80\\x9d  For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.  The door of the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s room opened, and he came out with Charles Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face. But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind.  He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.  Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling, glanced on the brideâ\\x80\\x99s hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s pockets. They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting.  It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, â\\x80\\x9cTake her, Charles! She is yours!â\\x80\\x9d  And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was gone.  The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow.  He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.  â\\x80\\x9cI think,â\\x80\\x9d he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, â\\x80\\x9cI think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him. I must look in at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s; so I will go there at once and come back presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well.â\\x80\\x9d  It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, than to look out of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.  â\\x80\\x9cGood God!â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a start. â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s that?â\\x80\\x9d  Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. â\\x80\\x9cO me, O me! All is lost!â\\x80\\x9d cried she, wringing her hands. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is to be told to Ladybird? He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know me, and is making shoes!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy.  â\\x80\\x9cDoctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!â\\x80\\x9d  The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.  He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.  Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was.  â\\x80\\x9cA young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s walking shoe,â\\x80\\x9d he muttered, without looking up. â\\x80\\x9cIt ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut, Doctor Manette. Look at me!â\\x80\\x9d  He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work.  â\\x80\\x9cYou know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper occupation. Think, dear friend!â\\x80\\x9d  Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.  Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post.  These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he thought the best, on the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s case.  In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s for the first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same room.  He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.  Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write. When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose and said to him:  â\\x80\\x9cWill you go out?â\\x80\\x9d  He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner, looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:  â\\x80\\x9cOut?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes; for a walk with me. Why not?â\\x80\\x9d  He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr. Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in some misty way asking himself, â\\x80\\x9cWhy not?â\\x80\\x9d The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.  Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his bench and to work.  On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name, and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.  When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:  â\\x80\\x9cDear Doctor, will you go out?â\\x80\\x9d  As before, he repeated, â\\x80\\x9cOut?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes; for a walk with me. Why not?â\\x80\\x9d  This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s return, he slipped away to his bench.  The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s hope darkened, and his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day. The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days.  With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening.     CHAPTER XIX. An Opinion   Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night.  He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive.  Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?  It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there? How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manetteâ\\x80\\x99s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom door in the early morning?  Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.  Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast.  So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s marriage had taken place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought. And that aid was his own.  Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less so.â\\x80\\x9d  Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced at his hands more than once.  â\\x80\\x9cDoctor Manette,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm, â\\x80\\x9cthe case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all, for his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s--his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s, my dear Manette.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf I understand,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, â\\x80\\x9csome mental shock--?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBe explicit,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor. â\\x80\\x9cSpare no detail.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately, there has been,â\\x80\\x9d he paused and took a deep breath--â\\x80\\x9ca slight relapse.â\\x80\\x9d  The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, â\\x80\\x9cOf how long duration?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNine days and nights.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow did it show itself? I infer,â\\x80\\x9d glancing at his hands again, â\\x80\\x9cin the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat is the fact.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow, did you ever see him,â\\x80\\x9d asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, â\\x80\\x9cengaged in that pursuit originally?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOnce.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all respects--as he was then?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think in all respects.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her. It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.â\\x80\\x9d  The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, â\\x80\\x9cThat was very kind. That was very thoughtful!â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of the two spoke for a little while.  â\\x80\\x9cNow, my dear Manette,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, â\\x80\\x9cI am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how.  â\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity, knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little. Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly, and teach me how to be a little more useful.â\\x80\\x9d  Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and Mr. Lorry did not press him.  â\\x80\\x9cI think it probable,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, â\\x80\\x9cthat the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite unforeseen by its subject.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWas it dreaded by him?â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.  â\\x80\\x9cVery much.â\\x80\\x9d He said it with an involuntary shudder.  â\\x80\\x9cYou have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the suffererâ\\x80\\x99s mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWould he,â\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cbe sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on him?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s arm again, after a short silence on both sides, â\\x80\\x9cto what would you refer this attack?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI believe,â\\x80\\x9d returned Doctor Manette, â\\x80\\x9cthat there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWould he remember what took place in the relapse?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Lorry, with natural hesitation.  The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and answered, in a low voice, â\\x80\\x9cNot at all.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow, as to the future,â\\x80\\x9d hinted Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cAs to the future,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, recovering firmness, â\\x80\\x9cI should have great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that the worst was over.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell, well! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s good comfort. I am thankful!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cI am thankful!â\\x80\\x9d repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.  â\\x80\\x9cThere are two other points,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9con which I am anxious to be instructed. I may go on?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou cannot do your friend a better service.â\\x80\\x9d The Doctor gave him his hand.  â\\x80\\x9cTo the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic; he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does he do too much?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are sure that he is not under too great a strain?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think I am quite sure of it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Manette, if he were overworked now--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment, that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do not think so. I do not think,â\\x80\\x9d said Doctor Manette with the firmness of self-conviction, â\\x80\\x9cthat anything but the one train of association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.â\\x80\\x9d  He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days, he knew that he must face it.  â\\x80\\x9cThe occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, â\\x80\\x9cwe will call--Blacksmithâ\\x80\\x99s work, Blacksmithâ\\x80\\x99s work. We will say, to put a case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?â\\x80\\x9d  The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot nervously on the ground.  â\\x80\\x9cHe has always kept it by him,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at his friend. â\\x80\\x9cNow, would it not be better that he should let it go?â\\x80\\x9d  Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the ground.  â\\x80\\x9cYou do not find it easy to advise me?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cI quite understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--â\\x80\\x9d And there he shook his head, and stopped.  â\\x80\\x9cYou see,â\\x80\\x9d said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause, â\\x80\\x9cit is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings of this poor manâ\\x80\\x99s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.â\\x80\\x9d  He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s face.  â\\x80\\x9cBut may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the forge?â\\x80\\x9d  There was another silence.  â\\x80\\x9cYou see, too,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, tremulously, â\\x80\\x9cit is such an old companion.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI would not keep it,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. â\\x80\\x9cI would recommend him to sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good. Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s sake, my dear Manette!â\\x80\\x9d  Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!  â\\x80\\x9cIn her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there; let him miss his old companion after an absence.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and she had no suspicions.  On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s bench to pieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible crime.     CHAPTER XX. A Plea   When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.  He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of speaking to him when no one overheard.  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Darnay,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, â\\x80\\x9cI wish we might be friends.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWe are already friends, I hope.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.â\\x80\\x9d  Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and good-fellowship, what he did mean?  â\\x80\\x9cUpon my life,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, smiling, â\\x80\\x9cI find that easier to comprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than usual?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day, when all days are at an end for me! Donâ\\x80\\x99t be alarmed; I am not going to preach.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming to me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that away. â\\x80\\x9cOn the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I wish you would forget it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI forgot it long ago.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it, and a light answer does not help me to forget it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf it was a light answer,â\\x80\\x9d returned Darnay, â\\x80\\x9cI beg your forgiveness for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAs to the great service,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, â\\x80\\x9cI am bound to avow to you, when you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou make light of the obligation,â\\x80\\x9d returned Darnay, â\\x80\\x9cbut I will not quarrel with _your_ light answer.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGenuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose; I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it, ask Stryver, and heâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done any good, and never will.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know that you â\\x80\\x98never will.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know that I had it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWill you try?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think so, Carton, by this time.â\\x80\\x9d  They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.  When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself.  He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked.  â\\x80\\x9cWe are thoughtful to-night!â\\x80\\x9d said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.  â\\x80\\x9cYes, dearest Charles,â\\x80\\x9d with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him; â\\x80\\x9cwe are rather thoughtful to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, my Lucie?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWill you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWill I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?â\\x80\\x9d  What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!  â\\x80\\x9cI think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, my own? Why so?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is a painful reflection to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, â\\x80\\x9cthat I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this of him.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous things.â\\x80\\x9d  She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd, O my dearest Love!â\\x80\\x9d she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, â\\x80\\x9cremember how strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!â\\x80\\x9d  The supplication touched him home. â\\x80\\x9cI will always remember it, dear Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.â\\x80\\x9d  He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time--  â\\x80\\x9cGod bless her for her sweet compassion!â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER XXI. Echoing Footsteps   A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years.  At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much. Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.  That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and the shady house was sunny with a childâ\\x80\\x99s laugh, and the Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred joy to her.  Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s step was strong and prosperous among them; her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s firm and equal. Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden!  Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant smile, â\\x80\\x9cDear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!â\\x80\\x9d those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young motherâ\\x80\\x99s cheek, as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Fatherâ\\x80\\x99s face. O Father, blessed words!  Thus, the rustling of an Angelâ\\x80\\x99s wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her motherâ\\x80\\x99s footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life.  The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.  No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of him, almost at the last. â\\x80\\x9cPoor Carton! Kiss him for me!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lionâ\\x80\\x99s jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.  These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to Lucieâ\\x80\\x99s husband: delicately saying â\\x80\\x9cHalloa! here are three lumps of bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!â\\x80\\x9d The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr. Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to â\\x80\\x9ccatchâ\\x80\\x9d him, and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him â\\x80\\x9cnot to be caught.â\\x80\\x9d Some of his Kingâ\\x80\\x99s Bench familiars, who were occasionally parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such offenderâ\\x80\\x99s being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.  These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her childâ\\x80\\x99s tread came, and those of her own dear fatherâ\\x80\\x99s, always active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husbandâ\\x80\\x99s, need not be told. Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?â\\x80\\x9d  But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about little Lucieâ\\x80\\x99s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.  On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place.  â\\x80\\x9cI began to think,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, â\\x80\\x9cthat I should have to pass the night at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s. We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat has a bad look,â\\x80\\x9d said Darnay--  â\\x80\\x9cA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we donâ\\x80\\x99t know what reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s are getting old, and we really canâ\\x80\\x99t be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cStill,â\\x80\\x9d said Darnay, â\\x80\\x9cyou know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI know that, to be sure,â\\x80\\x9d assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, â\\x80\\x9cbut I am determined to be peevish after my long dayâ\\x80\\x99s botheration. Where is Manette?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHere he is,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.  â\\x80\\x9cI am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without reason. You are not going out, I hope?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor.  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I canâ\\x80\\x99t see.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOf course, it has been kept for you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd sleeping soundly.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s right; all safe and well! I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now, come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear the echoes about which you have your theory.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot a theory; it was a fancy.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA fancy, then, my wise pet,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. â\\x80\\x9cThey are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!â\\x80\\x9d  Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in the dark London window.  Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind: all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.  Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat. Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.  As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging circled round Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself, already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms, thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.  â\\x80\\x9cKeep near to me, Jacques Three,â\\x80\\x9d cried Defarge; â\\x80\\x9cand do you, Jacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can. Where is my wife?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEh, well! Here you see me!â\\x80\\x9d said madame, composed as ever, but not knitting to-day. Madameâ\\x80\\x99s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife.  â\\x80\\x9cWhere do you go, my wife?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI go,â\\x80\\x9d said madame, â\\x80\\x9cwith you at present. You shall see me at the head of women, by-and-bye.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCome, then!â\\x80\\x9d cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. â\\x80\\x9cPatriots and friends, we are ready! The Bastille!â\\x80\\x9d  With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack began.  Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.  Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! â\\x80\\x9cWork, comrades all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!â\\x80\\x9d Thus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.  â\\x80\\x9cTo me, women!â\\x80\\x9d cried madame his wife. â\\x80\\x9cWhat! We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken!â\\x80\\x9d And to her, with a shrill thirsty cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and revenge.  Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot by the service of Four fierce hours.  A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!  So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet furious dumb-show.  â\\x80\\x9cThe Prisoners!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe Records!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe secret cells!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe instruments of torture!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe Prisoners!â\\x80\\x9d  Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, â\\x80\\x9cThe Prisoners!â\\x80\\x9d was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the wall.  â\\x80\\x9cShow me the North Tower!â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cQuick!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI will faithfully,â\\x80\\x9d replied the man, â\\x80\\x9cif you will come with me. But there is no one there.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?â\\x80\\x9d asked Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cQuick!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe meaning, monsieur?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDoes it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cKill him!â\\x80\\x9d croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.  â\\x80\\x9cMonsieur, it is a cell.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShow it me!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPass this way, then.â\\x80\\x9d  Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed, held by Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s arm as he held by the turnkeyâ\\x80\\x99s. Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray.  Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps, and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three, linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.  The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed in:  â\\x80\\x9cOne hundred and five, North Tower!â\\x80\\x9d  There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall, with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.  â\\x80\\x9cPass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge to the turnkey.  The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.  â\\x80\\x9cStop!--Look here, Jacques!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA. M.!â\\x80\\x9d croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.  â\\x80\\x9cAlexandre Manette,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. â\\x80\\x9cAnd here he wrote â\\x80\\x98a poor physician.â\\x80\\x99 And it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it me!â\\x80\\x9d  He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.  â\\x80\\x9cHold the light higher!â\\x80\\x9d he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. â\\x80\\x9cLook among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,â\\x80\\x9d  throwing it to him; â\\x80\\x9crip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the light higher, you!â\\x80\\x9d  With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a cautious touch.  â\\x80\\x9cNothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNothing.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLet us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light them, you!â\\x80\\x9d  The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once more.  They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people. Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the peopleâ\\x80\\x99s blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be unavenged.  In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a womanâ\\x80\\x99s. â\\x80\\x9cSee, there is my husband!â\\x80\\x9d she cried, pointing him out. â\\x80\\x9cSee Defarge!â\\x80\\x9d She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.  The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint Antoineâ\\x80\\x99s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the governorâ\\x80\\x99s body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. â\\x80\\x9cLower the lamp yonder!â\\x80\\x9d cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new means of death; â\\x80\\x9chere is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!â\\x80\\x9d The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.  The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.  But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits. Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, â\\x80\\x9cTHOU DIDST IT!â\\x80\\x9d  Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red.     CHAPTER XXII. The Sea Still Rises   Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saintâ\\x80\\x99s mercies. The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them.  Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: â\\x80\\x9cI know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?â\\x80\\x9d Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike. The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.  Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a starved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.  â\\x80\\x9cHark!â\\x80\\x9d said The Vengeance. â\\x80\\x9cListen, then! Who comes?â\\x80\\x9d  As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is Defarge,â\\x80\\x9d said madame. â\\x80\\x9cSilence, patriots!â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked around him! â\\x80\\x9cListen, everywhere!â\\x80\\x9d said madame again. â\\x80\\x9cListen to him!â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet.  â\\x80\\x9cSay then, my husband. What is it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNews from the other world!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow, then?â\\x80\\x9d cried madame, contemptuously. â\\x80\\x9cThe other world?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDoes everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEverybody!â\\x80\\x9d from all throats.  â\\x80\\x9cThe news is of him. He is among us!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAmong us!â\\x80\\x9d from the universal throat again. â\\x80\\x9cAnd dead?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot dead! He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! _Had_ he reason?â\\x80\\x9d  Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry.  A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.  â\\x80\\x9cPatriots!â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, in a determined voice, â\\x80\\x9care we ready?â\\x80\\x9d  Instantly Madame Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to house, rousing the women.  The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions. Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot.  Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoineâ\\x80\\x99s bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.  No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance, and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance from him in the Hall.  â\\x80\\x9cSee!â\\x80\\x9d cried madame, pointing with her knife. â\\x80\\x9cSee the old villain bound with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back. Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!â\\x80\\x9d Madame put her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.  The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.  At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection, directly down upon the old prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s head. The favour was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got him!  It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, â\\x80\\x9cBring him out! Bring him to the lamp!â\\x80\\x9d  Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.  Nor was this the end of the dayâ\\x80\\x99s bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the peopleâ\\x80\\x99s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through the streets.  Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakersâ\\x80\\x99 shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their doors.  Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped.  It was almost morning, when Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s wine-shop parted with its last knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in husky tones, while fastening the door:  â\\x80\\x9cAt last it is come, my dear!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEh well!â\\x80\\x9d returned madame. â\\x80\\x9cAlmost.â\\x80\\x9d  Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drumâ\\x80\\x99s was the only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint Antoineâ\\x80\\x99s bosom.     CHAPTER XXIII. Fire Rises   There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not be what he was ordered.  Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation. Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn out.  Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.  But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur.  For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.  Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather, as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail.  The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill, and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just intelligible:  â\\x80\\x9cHow goes it, Jacques?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAll well, Jacques.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTouch then!â\\x80\\x9d  They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.  â\\x80\\x9cNo dinner?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNothing but supper now,â\\x80\\x9d said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is the fashion,â\\x80\\x9d growled the man. â\\x80\\x9cI meet no dinner anywhere.â\\x80\\x9d  He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.  â\\x80\\x9cTouch then.â\\x80\\x9d It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.  â\\x80\\x9cTo-night?â\\x80\\x9d said the mender of roads.  â\\x80\\x9cTo-night,â\\x80\\x9d said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.  â\\x80\\x9cWhere?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHere.â\\x80\\x9d  He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.  â\\x80\\x9cShow me!â\\x80\\x9d said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.  â\\x80\\x9cSee!â\\x80\\x9d returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. â\\x80\\x9cYou go down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTo the Devil with all that!â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape. â\\x80\\x9c_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains. Well?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGood. When do you cease to work?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAt sunset.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWill you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you wake me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSurely.â\\x80\\x9d  The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. He was fast asleep directly.  As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account. The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips. Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.  The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then, the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village, roused him.  â\\x80\\x9cGood!â\\x80\\x9d said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. â\\x80\\x9cTwo leagues beyond the summit of the hill?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAbout.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAbout. Good!â\\x80\\x9d  The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village. When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.  The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black again.  But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous. Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches, and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.  A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelleâ\\x80\\x99s door. â\\x80\\x9cHelp, Gabelle! Help, every one!â\\x80\\x9d The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky. â\\x80\\x9cIt must be forty feet high,â\\x80\\x9d said they, grimly; and never moved.  The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. â\\x80\\x9cHelp, gentlemen--officers! The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid! Help, help!â\\x80\\x9d The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, â\\x80\\x9cIt must burn.â\\x80\\x9d  As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionaryâ\\x80\\x99s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast.  The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire.  The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.  Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below.  Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour. A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while.  Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned. The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully.     CHAPTER XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock   In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home.  Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted in.  Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after boldly reading the Lordâ\\x80\\x99s Prayer backwards for a great number of years, and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.  The shining Bullâ\\x80\\x99s Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Luciferâ\\x80\\x99s pride, Sardanapalusâ\\x80\\x99s luxury, and a moleâ\\x80\\x99s blindness--but it had dropped out and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and â\\x80\\x9csuspended,â\\x80\\x9d when the last tidings came over.  The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.  As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank. Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be. Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, almost as a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous, that Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read.  On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing.  â\\x80\\x9cBut, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,â\\x80\\x9d said Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, â\\x80\\x9cI must still suggest to you--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI understand. That I am too old?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cUnsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Charles,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, â\\x80\\x9cyou touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of old, and is in Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, after all these years, who ought to be?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI wish I were going myself,â\\x80\\x9d said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud.  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cYou wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You are a wise counsellor.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,â\\x80\\x9d he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, â\\x80\\x9cthat one might be listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night, after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhen you were talking to Lucie,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry repeated. â\\x80\\x9cYes. I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to France at this time of day!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHowever, I am not going,â\\x80\\x9d said Charles Darnay, with a smile. â\\x80\\x9cIt is more to the purpose that you say you are.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, â\\x80\\x9cyou can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harmâ\\x80\\x99s way, is within the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall I hang back, when Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s knows this and says this--Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, â\\x80\\x9cyou are to remember, that getting things out of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd do you really go to-night?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd do you take no one with you?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAll sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him. Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s proposal to retire and live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.â\\x80\\x9d  This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s usual desk, with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.  Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the Kingâ\\x80\\x99s Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.  The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran:  â\\x80\\x9cVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. EvrÃ©monde, of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.â\\x80\\x9d  On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.  â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; â\\x80\\x9cI have referred it, I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found.â\\x80\\x9d  The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s desk. He held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That, and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.  â\\x80\\x9cNephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the polished Marquis who was murdered,â\\x80\\x9d said one. â\\x80\\x9cHappy to say, I never knew him.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA craven who abandoned his post,â\\x80\\x9d said another--this Monseigneur had been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of hay--â\\x80\\x9csome years ago.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cInfected with the new doctrines,â\\x80\\x9d said a third, eyeing the direction through his glass in passing; â\\x80\\x9cset himself in opposition to the last Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to the ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHey?â\\x80\\x9d cried the blatant Stryver. â\\x80\\x9cDid he though? Is that the sort of fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!â\\x80\\x9d  Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on the shoulder, and said:  â\\x80\\x9cI know the fellow.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you, by Jupiter?â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver. â\\x80\\x9cI am sorry for it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy, Mr. Darnay? Dâ\\x80\\x99ye hear what he did? Donâ\\x80\\x99t ask, why, in these times.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut I do ask why?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll answer you. I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why.â\\x80\\x9d  Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and said: â\\x80\\x9cYou may not understand the gentleman.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,â\\x80\\x9d said Bully Stryver, â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _donâ\\x80\\x99t_ understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers, â\\x80\\x9cI know something of human nature, and I tell you that youâ\\x80\\x99ll never find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious _protÃ©gÃ©s_. No, gentlemen; heâ\\x80\\x99ll always show â\\x80\\x99em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.â\\x80\\x9d  With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in the general departure from the Bank.  â\\x80\\x9cWill you take charge of the letter?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cYou know where to deliver it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWill you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFrom here, at eight.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI will come back, to see you off.â\\x80\\x9d  Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it. These were its contents:   â\\x80\\x9cPrison of the Abbaye, Paris.  â\\x80\\x9cJune 21, 1792. â\\x80\\x9cMONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.  â\\x80\\x9cAfter having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the ground.  â\\x80\\x9cThe crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?  â\\x80\\x9cAh! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!  â\\x80\\x9cFor the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!  â\\x80\\x9cFrom this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.  â\\x80\\x9cYour afflicted,  â\\x80\\x9cGabelle.â\\x80\\x9d   The latent uneasiness in Darnayâ\\x80\\x99s mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.  He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold, he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie, his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to do it, and that it had never been done.  The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it.  But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear now.  This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make, that he would go to Paris.  Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison (injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur, which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelleâ\\x80\\x99s letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his justice, honour, and good name.  His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.  Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.  As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course.  He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now.  A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped.  â\\x80\\x9cI have delivered that letter,â\\x80\\x9d said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cI would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat I will, and readily,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cif it is not dangerous.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is his name?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand.  â\\x80\\x9cGabelle.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSimply, â\\x80\\x98that he has received the letter, and will come.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAny time mentioned?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAny person mentioned?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d  He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. â\\x80\\x9cMy love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry at parting, â\\x80\\x9cand take precious care of them till I come back.â\\x80\\x9d  Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away.  That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.  It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it, so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.  The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey. â\\x80\\x9cFor the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name!â\\x80\\x9d was the poor prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and floated away for the Loadstone Rock.   The end of the second book.     Book the Third--the Track of a Storm     CHAPTER I. In Secret   The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.  A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journeyâ\\x80\\x99s end. Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England. The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.  This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.  Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelleâ\\x80\\x99s letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.  Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.  â\\x80\\x9cEmigrant,â\\x80\\x9d said the functionary, â\\x80\\x9cI am going to send you on to Paris, under an escort.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCitizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could dispense with the escort.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSilence!â\\x80\\x9d growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket. â\\x80\\x9cPeace, aristocrat!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is as the good patriot says,â\\x80\\x9d observed the timid functionary. â\\x80\\x9cYou are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have no choice,â\\x80\\x9d said Charles Darnay.  â\\x80\\x9cChoice! Listen to him!â\\x80\\x9d cried the same scowling red-cap. â\\x80\\x9cAs if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is always as the good patriot says,â\\x80\\x9d observed the functionary. â\\x80\\x9cRise and dress yourself, emigrant.â\\x80\\x9d  Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he started with it on the wet, wet roads at three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning.  The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either side of him.  The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement, and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital.  They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.  But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide, when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called out loudly, â\\x80\\x9cDown with the emigrant!â\\x80\\x9d  He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and, resuming it as his safest place, said:  â\\x80\\x9cEmigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own will?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are a cursed emigrant,â\\x80\\x9d cried a farrier, making at him in a furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; â\\x80\\x9cand you are a cursed aristocrat!â\\x80\\x9d  The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the riderâ\\x80\\x99s bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, â\\x80\\x9cLet him be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJudged!â\\x80\\x9d repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. â\\x80\\x9cAy! and condemned as a traitor.â\\x80\\x9d At this the crowd roared approval.  Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horseâ\\x80\\x99s head to the yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his voice heard:  â\\x80\\x9cFriends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a traitor.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe lies!â\\x80\\x9d cried the smith. â\\x80\\x9cHe is a traitor since the decree. His life is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!â\\x80\\x9d  At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horseâ\\x80\\x99s flanks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no more was done.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is this decree that the smith spoke of?â\\x80\\x9d Darnay asked the postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.  â\\x80\\x9cTruly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhen passed?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOn the fourteenth.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe day I left England!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEverybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut there are no such decrees yet?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat do I know!â\\x80\\x9d said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; â\\x80\\x9cthere may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?â\\x80\\x9d  They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night, circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.  Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.  â\\x80\\x9cWhere are the papers of this prisoner?â\\x80\\x9d demanded a resolute-looking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.  Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.  â\\x80\\x9cWhere,â\\x80\\x9d repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him whatever, â\\x80\\x9care the papers of this prisoner?â\\x80\\x9d  The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his eyes over Gabelleâ\\x80\\x99s letter, the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.  He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress into the city for peasantsâ\\x80\\x99 carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men and women.  When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority, who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse, turned and rode away without entering the city.  He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.  â\\x80\\x9cCitizen Defarge,â\\x80\\x9d said he to Darnayâ\\x80\\x99s conductor, as he took a slip of paper to write on. â\\x80\\x9cIs this the emigrant EvrÃ©monde?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThis is the man.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYour age, EvrÃ©monde?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThirty-seven.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMarried, EvrÃ©monde?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhere married?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIn England.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWithout doubt. Where is your wife, EvrÃ©monde?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIn England.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWithout doubt. You are consigned, EvrÃ©monde, to the prison of La Force.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJust Heaven!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Darnay. â\\x80\\x9cUnder what law, and for what offence?â\\x80\\x9d  The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.  â\\x80\\x9cWe have new laws, EvrÃ©monde, and new offences, since you were here.â\\x80\\x9d He said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.  â\\x80\\x9cI entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that my right?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cEmigrants have no rights, EvrÃ©monde,â\\x80\\x9d was the stolid reply. The officer wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written, sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words â\\x80\\x9cIn secret.â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended them.  â\\x80\\x9cIs it you,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, â\\x80\\x9cwho married the daughter of Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.  â\\x80\\x9cMy name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!â\\x80\\x9d  The word â\\x80\\x9cwifeâ\\x80\\x9d seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say with sudden impatience, â\\x80\\x9cIn the name of that sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the truth?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA bad truth for you,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and looking straight before him.  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a little help?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNone.â\\x80\\x9d Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.  â\\x80\\x9cWill you answer me a single question?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIn this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou will see.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of presenting my case?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons, before now.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut never by me, Citizen Defarge.â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree. He, therefore, made haste to say:  â\\x80\\x9cIt is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to Mr. Lorry of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI will do,â\\x80\\x9d Defarge doggedly rejoined, â\\x80\\x9cnothing for you. My duty is to my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you. I will do nothing for you.â\\x80\\x9d  Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family. The few words that he caught from this manâ\\x80\\x99s lips, first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him.  That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away. The â\\x80\\x9csharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine,â\\x80\\x9d was hardly known to him, or to the generality of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?  Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he arrived at the prison of La Force.  A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge presented â\\x80\\x9cThe Emigrant EvrÃ©monde.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat the Devil! How many more of them!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the man with the bloated face.  Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with his two fellow-patriots.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat the Devil, I say again!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife. â\\x80\\x9cHow many more!â\\x80\\x9d  The gaolerâ\\x80\\x99s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely replied, â\\x80\\x9cOne must have patience, my dear!â\\x80\\x9d Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, â\\x80\\x9cFor the love of Liberty;â\\x80\\x9d which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion.  The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for!  â\\x80\\x9cIn secret, too,â\\x80\\x9d grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. â\\x80\\x9cAs if I was not already full to bursting!â\\x80\\x9d  He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates.  â\\x80\\x9cCome!â\\x80\\x9d said the chief, at length taking up his keys, â\\x80\\x9ccome with me, emigrant.â\\x80\\x9d  Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the room.  In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.  So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.  It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!  â\\x80\\x9cIn the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,â\\x80\\x9d said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, â\\x80\\x9cI have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?â\\x80\\x9d  Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in words as suitable as he could find.  â\\x80\\x9cBut I hope,â\\x80\\x9d said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his eyes, who moved across the room, â\\x80\\x9cthat you are not in secret?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted but a short time.â\\x80\\x9d Then he added, raising his voice, â\\x80\\x9cI grieve to inform the society--in secret.â\\x80\\x9d  There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaolerâ\\x80\\x99s hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.  The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.  â\\x80\\x9cYours,â\\x80\\x9d said the gaoler.  â\\x80\\x9cWhy am I confined alone?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow do I know!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI can buy pen, ink, and paper?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSuch are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.â\\x80\\x9d  There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was gone, he thought in the same wandering way, â\\x80\\x9cNow am I left, as if I were dead.â\\x80\\x9d Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, â\\x80\\x9cAnd here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFive paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half.â\\x80\\x9d The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell, counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. â\\x80\\x9cHe made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes.â\\x80\\x9d The prisoner counted the measurement again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition. â\\x80\\x9cThe ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and a half.â\\x80\\x9d With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he knew, in the swell that rose above them.     CHAPTER II. The Grindstone   Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles, in his own cookâ\\x80\\x99s dress, and got across the borders. A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question.  Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneurâ\\x80\\x99s house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneurâ\\x80\\x99s house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its state apartments.  A place of business in London like Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s place of business in Paris, would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette. For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s had whitewashed the Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest provocation. Yet, a French Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.  What money would be drawn out of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s henceforth, and what would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.  He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.  From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven.  â\\x80\\x9cThank God,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, â\\x80\\x9cthat no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all who are in danger!â\\x80\\x9d  Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought, â\\x80\\x9cThey have come back!â\\x80\\x9d and sat listening. But, there was no loud irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate clash again, and all was quiet.  The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement.  Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is this?â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?â\\x80\\x9d  With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, â\\x80\\x9cO my dear friend! My husband!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYour husband, Lucie?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCharles.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat of Charles?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHere.  â\\x80\\x9cHere, in Paris?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHas been here some days--three or four--I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how many--I canâ\\x80\\x99t collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.â\\x80\\x9d  The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is that noise?â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, turning towards the window.  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t look!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t look out! Manette, for your life, donâ\\x80\\x99t touch the blind!â\\x80\\x9d  The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool, bold smile:  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph. My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so.--What is that noise?â\\x80\\x9d His hand was again upon the window.  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t look!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. â\\x80\\x9cNo, Lucie, my dear, nor you!â\\x80\\x9d He got his arm round her, and held her. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be so terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place. What prison is he in?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLa Force!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLa Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you to do for Charlesâ\\x80\\x99s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this. I know you are true.â\\x80\\x9d  The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s arm, and looked out with him into the courtyard.  Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.  But, such awful workers, and such awful work!  The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise. False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of womenâ\\x80\\x99s lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.  All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friendâ\\x80\\x99s ashy face.  â\\x80\\x9cThey are,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at the locked room, â\\x80\\x9cmurdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It may be too late, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, but let it not be a minute later!â\\x80\\x9d  Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.  His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone. For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him, surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of--â\\x80\\x9cLive the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save the prisoner EvrÃ©monde at La Force!â\\x80\\x9d and a thousand answering shouts.  He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew.  Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!  Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d cried Lucie, affrighted. â\\x80\\x9cHush! The soldiersâ\\x80\\x99 swords are sharpened there,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cThe place is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my love.â\\x80\\x9d  Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful. Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air. Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle, climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions.  The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away.     CHAPTER III. The Shadow   One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to imperil Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child, without a momentâ\\x80\\x99s demur; but the great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.  At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.  Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minuteâ\\x80\\x99s delay tending to compromise Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.  To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself. He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations. A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.  It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him, addressed him by his name.  â\\x80\\x9cYour servant,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cDo you know me?â\\x80\\x9d  He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of emphasis, the words:  â\\x80\\x9cDo you know me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have seen you somewhere.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps at my wine-shop?â\\x80\\x9d  Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: â\\x80\\x9cYou come from Doctor Manette?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes. I come from Doctor Manette.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd what says he? What does he send me?â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the words in the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s writing:      â\\x80\\x9cCharles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.      I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note      from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife.â\\x80\\x9d  It was dated from La Force, within an hour.  â\\x80\\x9cWill you accompany me,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud, â\\x80\\x9cto where his wife resides?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d returned Defarge.  Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.  â\\x80\\x9cMadame Defarge, surely!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is she,â\\x80\\x9d observed her husband.  â\\x80\\x9cDoes Madame go with us?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as they moved.  â\\x80\\x9cYes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons. It is for their safety.â\\x80\\x9d  Beginning to be struck by Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being The Vengeance.  They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might, ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.       â\\x80\\x9cDEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has       influence around me.  You cannot answer this.       Kiss our child for me.â\\x80\\x9d  That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.  There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; â\\x80\\x9cthere are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she may identify them. I believe,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, â\\x80\\x9cI state the case, Citizen Defarge?â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence.  â\\x80\\x9cYou had better, Lucie,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, â\\x80\\x9chave the dear child here, and our good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.â\\x80\\x9d  The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, â\\x80\\x9cWell, I am sure, Boldface! I hope _you_ are pretty well!â\\x80\\x9d She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.  â\\x80\\x9cIs that his child?â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate.  â\\x80\\x9cYes, madame,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Lorry; â\\x80\\x9cthis is our poor prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s darling daughter, and only child.â\\x80\\x9d  The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is enough, my husband,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cI have seen them. We may go.â\\x80\\x9d  But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s dress:  â\\x80\\x9cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYour husband is not my business here,â\\x80\\x9d returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. â\\x80\\x9cIt is the daughter of your father who is my business here.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my childâ\\x80\\x99s sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.â\\x80\\x9d  Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it that your husband says in that little letter?â\\x80\\x9d asked Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile. â\\x80\\x9cInfluence; he says something touching influence?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat my father,â\\x80\\x9d said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, â\\x80\\x9chas much influence around him.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSurely it will release him!â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cLet it do so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAs a wife and mother,â\\x80\\x9d cried Lucie, most earnestly, â\\x80\\x9cI implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think of me. As a wife and mother!â\\x80\\x9d  Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said, turning to her friend The Vengeance:  â\\x80\\x9cThe wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them, often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst, sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWe have seen nothing else,â\\x80\\x9d returned The Vengeance.  â\\x80\\x9cWe have borne this a long time,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes again upon Lucie. â\\x80\\x9cJudge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now?â\\x80\\x9d  She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge went last, and closed the door.  â\\x80\\x9cCourage, my dear Lucie,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. â\\x80\\x9cCourage, courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTut, tut!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry; â\\x80\\x9cwhat is this despondency in the brave little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.â\\x80\\x9d  But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself, for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.     CHAPTER IV. Calm in Storm   Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.  To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this man was Defarge.  That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That, the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.  The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.  As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.  But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s husband, and deliver him. â\\x80\\x9cIt all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin. As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of Heaven I will do it!â\\x80\\x9d Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.  Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s hand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.  This new life of the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it. Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charlesâ\\x80\\x99s ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. â\\x80\\x9cAll curious to see,â\\x80\\x9d thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, â\\x80\\x9cbut all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be in better hands.â\\x80\\x9d  But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragonâ\\x80\\x99s teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore. What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!  There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.  And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old. Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the sharp female called La Guillotine.  It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied.  It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes. The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of Godâ\\x80\\x99s own Temple every day.  Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucieâ\\x80\\x99s husband at last. Yet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving among mortals.     CHAPTER V. The Wood-Sawyer   One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst. Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!  If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time, had stunned the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good will always be.  As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught, as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.  She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven, was on him. He always resolutely answered: â\\x80\\x9cNothing can happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.â\\x80\\x9d  They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her father said to her, on coming home one evening:  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cO show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.â\\x80\\x9d  From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away. When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a single day.  It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed her.  â\\x80\\x9cGood day, citizeness.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGood day, citizen.â\\x80\\x9d  This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody.  â\\x80\\x9cWalking here again, citizeness?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou see me, citizen!â\\x80\\x9d  The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars, peeped through them jocosely.  â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s not my business,â\\x80\\x9d said he. And went on sawing his wood.  Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she appeared.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat? Walking here again, citizeness?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, citizen.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo I say yes, mamma?â\\x80\\x9d whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.  â\\x80\\x9cYes, dearest.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, citizen.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh! But itâ\\x80\\x99s not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head comes!â\\x80\\x9d  The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.  â\\x80\\x9cI call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again! Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her_ head comes! Now, a child. Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the family!â\\x80\\x9d  Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.  He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s not my business!â\\x80\\x9d he would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again.  In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall. Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have waited out the day, seven days a week.  These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!  The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his â\\x80\\x9cLittle Sainte Guillotineâ\\x80\\x9d--for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.  But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They advanced, retreated, struck at one anotherâ\\x80\\x99s hands, clutched at one anotherâ\\x80\\x99s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-childâ\\x80\\x99s head thus distracted, the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of the disjointed time.  This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyerâ\\x80\\x99s house, the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.  â\\x80\\x9cO my father!â\\x80\\x9d for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand; â\\x80\\x9csuch a cruel, bad sight.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be frightened! Not one of them would harm you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my husband, and the mercies of these people--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWe will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou cannot see him, my poor dear?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo, father,â\\x80\\x9d said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand, â\\x80\\x9cno.â\\x80\\x9d  A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cI salute you, citizeness,â\\x80\\x9d  from the Doctor. â\\x80\\x9cI salute you, citizen.â\\x80\\x9d This in passing. Nothing more. Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.  â\\x80\\x9cGive me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage, for his sake. That was well done;â\\x80\\x9d they had left the spot; â\\x80\\x9cit shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFor to-morrow!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?â\\x80\\x9d  She could scarcely answer, â\\x80\\x9cI trust in you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every protection. I must see Lorry.â\\x80\\x9d  He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.  â\\x80\\x9cI must see Lorry,â\\x80\\x9d the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.  The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No better man living to hold fast by what Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s had in keeping, and to hold his peace.  A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!  Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the chair--who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued, he said: â\\x80\\x9cRemoved to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER VI. Triumph   The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The standard gaoler-joke was, â\\x80\\x9cCome out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside there!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCharles EvrÃ©monde, called Darnay!â\\x80\\x9d  So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.  When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles EvrÃ©monde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen hundreds pass away so.  His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold.  There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.  The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnayâ\\x80\\x99s name was called. All the fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.  â\\x80\\x9cCharles EvrÃ©monde, called Darnay,â\\x80\\x9d was at length arraigned.  His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men, the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette, in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr. Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole.  Charles EvrÃ©monde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.  â\\x80\\x9cTake off his head!â\\x80\\x9d cried the audience. â\\x80\\x9cAn enemy to the Republic!â\\x80\\x9d  The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England?  Undoubtedly it was.  Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?  Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.  Why not? the President desired to know.  Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.  What proof had he of this?  He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette.  But he had married in England? the President reminded him.  True, but not an English woman.  A citizeness of France?  Yes. By birth.  Her name and family?  â\\x80\\x9cLucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there.â\\x80\\x9d  This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.  On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manetteâ\\x80\\x99s reiterated instructions. The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road.  The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not sooner?  He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England, he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature. He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his absence. He had come back, to save a citizenâ\\x80\\x99s life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic?  The populace cried enthusiastically, â\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d and the President rang his bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry â\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d  until they left off, of their own will.  The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence to the citizenâ\\x80\\x99s letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier, but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President.  The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out of the Tribunalâ\\x80\\x99s patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Juryâ\\x80\\x99s declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen EvrÃ©monde, called Darnay.  Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them.  At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s favour, and the President declared him free.  Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.  His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, â\\x80\\x9cLong live the Republic!â\\x80\\x9d  The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.  They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages. Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not even the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on menâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.  In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.  As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole. Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the riverâ\\x80\\x99s bank, and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away.  After grasping the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s hand, as he stood victorious and proud before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole; after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms.  â\\x80\\x9cLucie! My own! I am safe.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cO dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him.â\\x80\\x9d  They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in his arms, he said to her:  â\\x80\\x9cAnd now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France could have done what he has done for me.â\\x80\\x9d  She laid her head upon her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s breast, as she had laid his poor head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his strength. â\\x80\\x9cYou must not be weak, my darling,â\\x80\\x9d he remonstrated; â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t tremble so. I have saved him.â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER VII. A Knock at the Door   â\\x80\\x9cI have saved him.â\\x80\\x9d It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her.  All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.  Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this womanâ\\x80\\x99s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let them all lean upon him.  Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment, had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night.  It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr. Jerry Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of Charles EvrÃ©monde, called Darnay.  In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s little household, as in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.  For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long association with a French family, might have known as much of their language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that direction; consequently she knew no more of that â\\x80\\x9cnonsenseâ\\x80\\x9d (as she was pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.  â\\x80\\x9cNow, Mr. Cruncher,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity; â\\x80\\x9cif you are ready, I am.â\\x80\\x9d  Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s service. He had worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.  â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s all manner of things wanted,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cand we shall have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,â\\x80\\x9d  retorted Jerry, â\\x80\\x9cwhether they drink your health or the Old Unâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhoâ\\x80\\x99s he?â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross.  Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning â\\x80\\x9cOld Nickâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHa!â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cit doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and itâ\\x80\\x99s Midnight Murder, and Mischief.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lucie.  â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be cautious,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross; â\\x80\\x9cbut I may say among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back! Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and donâ\\x80\\x99t move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again! May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think you may take that liberty,â\\x80\\x9d the Doctor answered, smiling.  â\\x80\\x9cFor gracious sake, donâ\\x80\\x99t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of that,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross.  â\\x80\\x9cHush, dear! Again?â\\x80\\x9d Lucie remonstrated.  â\\x80\\x9cWell, my sweet,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, â\\x80\\x9cthe short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;â\\x80\\x9d Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; â\\x80\\x9cand as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.  â\\x80\\x9cI am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, approvingly. â\\x80\\x9cBut the question, Doctor Manette. Is thereâ\\x80\\x9d--it was the good creatureâ\\x80\\x99s way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--â\\x80\\x9cis there any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHeigh-ho-hum!â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darlingâ\\x80\\x99s golden hair in the light of the fire, â\\x80\\x9cthen we must have patience and wait: thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Donâ\\x80\\x99t you move, Ladybird!â\\x80\\x9d  They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he, in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is that?â\\x80\\x9d she cried, all at once.  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear!â\\x80\\x9d said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand on hers, â\\x80\\x9ccommand yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s daughter!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI thought, my father,â\\x80\\x9d said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face and in a faltering voice, â\\x80\\x9cthat I heard strange feet upon the stairs.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy love, the staircase is as still as Death.â\\x80\\x9d  As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.  â\\x80\\x9cOh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy child,â\\x80\\x9d said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her shoulder, â\\x80\\x9cI _have_ saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go to the door.â\\x80\\x9d  He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms, and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.  â\\x80\\x9cThe Citizen EvrÃ©monde, called Darnay,â\\x80\\x9d said the first.  â\\x80\\x9cWho seeks him?â\\x80\\x9d answered Darnay.  â\\x80\\x9cI seek him. We seek him. I know you, EvrÃ©monde; I saw you before the Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic.â\\x80\\x9d  The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him.  â\\x80\\x9cTell me how and why am I again a prisoner?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d  Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red woollen shirt, said:  â\\x80\\x9cYou know him, you have said. Do you know me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWe all know you, Citizen Doctor,â\\x80\\x9d said the other three.  He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice, after a pause:  â\\x80\\x9cWill you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCitizen Doctor,â\\x80\\x9d said the first, reluctantly, â\\x80\\x9che has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,â\\x80\\x9d pointing out the second who had entered, â\\x80\\x9cis from Saint Antoine.â\\x80\\x9d  The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:  â\\x80\\x9cHe is accused by Saint Antoine.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOf what?â\\x80\\x9d asked the Doctor.  â\\x80\\x9cCitizen Doctor,â\\x80\\x9d said the first, with his former reluctance, â\\x80\\x9cask no more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all. The People is supreme. EvrÃ©monde, we are pressed.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOne word,â\\x80\\x9d the Doctor entreated. â\\x80\\x9cWill you tell me who denounced him?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is against rule,â\\x80\\x9d answered the first; â\\x80\\x9cbut you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here.â\\x80\\x9d  The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:  â\\x80\\x9cWell! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced--and gravely--by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat other?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen,â\\x80\\x9d said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, â\\x80\\x9cyou will be answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER VIII. A Hand at Cards   Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.  Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted. After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace, once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by her cavalier.  Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth, playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted, bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted.  As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped her hands.  In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman, evidently English.  What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter?â\\x80\\x9d said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in English.  â\\x80\\x9cOh, Solomon, dear Solomon!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again. â\\x80\\x9cAfter not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?â\\x80\\x9d asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way.  â\\x80\\x9cBrother, brother!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. â\\x80\\x9cHave I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen hold your meddlesome tongue,â\\x80\\x9d said Solomon, â\\x80\\x9cand come out, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Whoâ\\x80\\x99s this man?â\\x80\\x9d  Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother, said through her tears, â\\x80\\x9cMr. Cruncher.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLet him come out too,â\\x80\\x9d said Solomon. â\\x80\\x9cDoes he think me a ghost?â\\x80\\x9d  Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.  â\\x80\\x9cNow,â\\x80\\x9d said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you want?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cto give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere. Confound it! There,â\\x80\\x9d said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s lips with his own. â\\x80\\x9cNow are you content?â\\x80\\x9d  Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.  â\\x80\\x9cIf you expect me to be surprised,â\\x80\\x9d said her brother Solomon, â\\x80\\x9cI am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If you really donâ\\x80\\x99t want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I am an official.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy English brother Solomon,â\\x80\\x9d mourned Miss Pross, casting up her tear-fraught eyes, â\\x80\\x9cthat had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI said so!â\\x80\\x9d cried her brother, interrupting. â\\x80\\x9cI knew it. You want to be the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just as I am getting on!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Pross. â\\x80\\x9cFar rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me, and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will detain you no longer.â\\x80\\x9d  Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent her money and left her!  He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question:  â\\x80\\x9cI say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon, or Solomon John?â\\x80\\x9d  The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not previously uttered a word.  â\\x80\\x9cCome!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher. â\\x80\\x9cSpeak out, you know.â\\x80\\x9d (Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.) â\\x80\\x9cJohn Solomon, or Solomon John? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know youâ\\x80\\x99re John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warnâ\\x80\\x99t your name over the water.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know all I mean, for I canâ\\x80\\x99t call to mind what your name was, over the water.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll swear it was a name of two syllables.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIndeed?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes. Tâ\\x80\\x99other oneâ\\x80\\x99s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to yourself, was you called at that time?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBarsad,â\\x80\\x9d said another voice, striking in.  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the name for a thousand pound!â\\x80\\x9d cried Jerry.  The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s, to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons.â\\x80\\x9d  Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--  â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney. â\\x80\\x9cI lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat purpose?â\\x80\\x9d the spy asked.  â\\x80\\x9cIt would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your company--at the office of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s Bank, for instance?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cUnder a threat?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh! Did I say that?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen, why should I go there?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cReally, Mr. Barsad, I canâ\\x80\\x99t say, if you canâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you mean that you wonâ\\x80\\x99t say, sir?â\\x80\\x9d the spy irresolutely asked.  â\\x80\\x9cYou apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d  Cartonâ\\x80\\x99s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind, and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and made the most of it.  â\\x80\\x9cNow, I told you so,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his sister; â\\x80\\x9cif any trouble comes of this, itâ\\x80\\x99s your doing.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCome, come, Mr. Barsad!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Sydney. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be ungrateful. But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go with you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s with us. Are we ready? Come then!â\\x80\\x9d  Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydneyâ\\x80\\x99s arm and looked up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection, and with Sydneyâ\\x80\\x99s friendly reassurances, adequately to heed what she observed.  They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s, which was within a few minutesâ\\x80\\x99 walk. John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side.  Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger.  â\\x80\\x9cMiss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s brother, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Barsad.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBarsad?â\\x80\\x9d repeated the old gentleman, â\\x80\\x9cBarsad? I have an association with the name--and with the face.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,â\\x80\\x9d observed Carton, coolly. â\\x80\\x9cPray sit down.â\\x80\\x9d  As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, â\\x80\\x9cWitness at that trial.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence.  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney, â\\x80\\x9cand has acknowledged the relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.â\\x80\\x9d  Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cArrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJust now, if at all.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney, â\\x80\\x9cand I have it from Mr. Barsadâ\\x80\\x99s communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s business eye read in the speakerâ\\x80\\x99s face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was silently attentive.  â\\x80\\x9cNow, I trust,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney to him, â\\x80\\x9cthat the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes; I believe so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manetteâ\\x80\\x99s not having had the power to prevent this arrest.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe may not have known of it beforehand,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cBut that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s true,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.  â\\x80\\x9cIn short,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney, â\\x80\\x9cthis is a desperate time, when desperate games are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I will play the losing one. No manâ\\x80\\x99s life here is worth purchase. Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou need have good cards, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy.  â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll run them over. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish youâ\\x80\\x99d give me a little brandy.â\\x80\\x9d  It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Barsad,â\\x80\\x9d he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: â\\x80\\x9cSheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot to understand your play,â\\x80\\x9d returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.  â\\x80\\x9cI play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Donâ\\x80\\x99t hurry.â\\x80\\x9d  He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured out and drank another glassful.  â\\x80\\x9cLook over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.â\\x80\\x9d  It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manetteâ\\x80\\x99s imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved. He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.  â\\x80\\x9cYou scarcely seem to like your hand,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney, with the greatest composure. â\\x80\\x9cDo you play?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cI may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, taking the answer on himself, and looking at his watch, â\\x80\\x9cwithout any scruple, in a very few minutes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI should have hoped, gentlemen both,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy, always striving to hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, â\\x80\\x9cthat your respect for my sister--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney Carton.  â\\x80\\x9cYou think not, sir?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have thoroughly made up my mind about it.â\\x80\\x9d  The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour, received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air of contemplating cards:  â\\x80\\x9cAnd indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons; who was he?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFrench. You donâ\\x80\\x99t know him,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy, quickly.  â\\x80\\x9cFrench, eh?â\\x80\\x9d repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him at all, though he echoed his word. â\\x80\\x9cWell; he may be.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs, I assure you,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy; â\\x80\\x9cthough itâ\\x80\\x99s not important.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThough itâ\\x80\\x99s not important,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Carton, in the same mechanical way--â\\x80\\x9cthough itâ\\x80\\x99s not important--No, itâ\\x80\\x99s not important. No. Yet I know the face.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI think not. I am sure not. It canâ\\x80\\x99t be,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy.  â\\x80\\x9cIt-canâ\\x80\\x99t-be,â\\x80\\x9d muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. â\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t-be. Spoke good French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cProvincial,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy.  â\\x80\\x9cNo. Foreign!â\\x80\\x9d cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a light broke clearly on his mind. â\\x80\\x9cCly! Disguised, but the same man. We had that man before us at the Old Bailey.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow, there you are hasty, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Barsad, with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; â\\x80\\x9cthere you really give me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin.â\\x80\\x9d  Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s head.  â\\x80\\x9cLet us be reasonable,â\\x80\\x9d said the spy, â\\x80\\x9cand let us be fair. To show you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will lay before you a certificate of Clyâ\\x80\\x99s burial, which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book,â\\x80\\x9d with a hurried hand he produced and opened it, â\\x80\\x9cever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take it in your hand; itâ\\x80\\x99s no forgery.â\\x80\\x9d  Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.  Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.  â\\x80\\x9cThat there Roger Cly, master,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and iron-bound visage. â\\x80\\x9cSo _you_ put him in his coffin?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI did.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWho took him out of it?â\\x80\\x9d  Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI mean,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, â\\x80\\x9cthat he warnâ\\x80\\x99t never in it. No! Not he! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.â\\x80\\x9d  The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.  â\\x80\\x9cI tell you,â\\x80\\x9d said Jerry, â\\x80\\x9cthat you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin. Donâ\\x80\\x99t go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a take in. Me and two more knows it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow do you know it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s that to you? Ecod!â\\x80\\x9d growled Mr. Cruncher, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s you I have got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen! Iâ\\x80\\x99d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and explain himself.  â\\x80\\x9cAt another time, sir,â\\x80\\x9d he returned, evasively, â\\x80\\x9cthe present time is ill-conwenient for explaininâ\\x80\\x99. What I stand to, is, that he knows well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was, in so much as a word of one syllable, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea;â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer; â\\x80\\x9cor Iâ\\x80\\x99ll out and announce him.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHumph! I see one thing,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton. â\\x80\\x9cI hold another card, Mr. Barsad. Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again! A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d returned the spy. â\\x80\\x9cI throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNever you trouble your head about this man,â\\x80\\x9d retorted the contentious Mr. Cruncher; â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman. And look here! Once more!â\\x80\\x9d--Mr. Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberality--â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.â\\x80\\x9d  The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said, with more decision, â\\x80\\x9cIt has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and canâ\\x80\\x99t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it? Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short, I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNot very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,â\\x80\\x9d  said the spy, firmly.  â\\x80\\x9cWhy need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am sometimes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou can be when you choose?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI can pass in and out when I choose.â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he said, rising:  â\\x80\\x9cSo far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.â\\x80\\x9d     CHAPTER IX. The Game Made   While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesmanâ\\x80\\x99s manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.  â\\x80\\x9cJerry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cCome here.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance of him.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat have you been, besides a messenger?â\\x80\\x9d  After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, â\\x80\\x9cAgicultooral character.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy mind misgives me much,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger at him, â\\x80\\x9cthat you have used the respectable and great house of Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description. If you have, donâ\\x80\\x99t expect me to befriend you when you get back to England. If you have, donâ\\x80\\x99t expect me to keep your secret. Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s shall not be imposed upon.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI hope, sir,â\\x80\\x9d pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, â\\x80\\x9cthat a gentleman like yourself wot Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had the honour of odd jobbing till Iâ\\x80\\x99m grey at it, would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I donâ\\x80\\x99t say it is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if it wos, it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t, even then, be all oâ\\x80\\x99 one side. Thereâ\\x80\\x99d be two sides to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman donâ\\x80\\x99t pick up his fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s, and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so. Well, that â\\x80\\x99ud be imposing, too, on Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s. For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander. And hereâ\\x80\\x99s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given, a floppinâ\\x80\\x99 again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark ruinating! Whereas them medical doctorsâ\\x80\\x99 wives donâ\\x80\\x99t flop--catch â\\x80\\x99em at it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly have one without tâ\\x80\\x99other? Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t get much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. Heâ\\x80\\x99d never have no good of it; heâ\\x80\\x99d want all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being once in--even if it wos so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cUgh!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, â\\x80\\x9cI am shocked at the sight of you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,â\\x80\\x9d pursued Mr. Cruncher, â\\x80\\x9ceven if it wos so, which I donâ\\x80\\x99t say it is--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t prevaricate,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry.  â\\x80\\x9cNo, I will _not_, sir,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice--â\\x80\\x9cwhich I donâ\\x80\\x99t say it is--wot I would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it wos so, which I still donâ\\x80\\x99t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to you, sir), let that there boy keep his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s place, and take care of his mother; donâ\\x80\\x99t blow upon that boyâ\\x80\\x99s father--do not do it, sir--and let that father go into the line of the regâ\\x80\\x99lar digginâ\\x80\\x99, and make amends for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by digginâ\\x80\\x99 of â\\x80\\x99em in with a will, and with conwictions respectinâ\\x80\\x99 the futurâ\\x80\\x99 keepinâ\\x80\\x99 of â\\x80\\x99em safe. That, Mr. Lorry,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse, â\\x80\\x9cis wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man donâ\\x80\\x99t see all this here a goinâ\\x80\\x99 on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that, without havinâ\\x80\\x99 his serious thoughts of things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatinâ\\x80\\x99 of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might have kepâ\\x80\\x99 it back.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat at least is true,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cSay no more now. It may be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in action--not in words. I want no more words.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room. â\\x80\\x9cAdieu, Mr. Barsad,â\\x80\\x9d said the former; â\\x80\\x9cour arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.â\\x80\\x9d  He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?  â\\x80\\x9cNot much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access to him, once.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s countenance fell.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is all I could do,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton. â\\x80\\x9cTo propose too much, would be to put this manâ\\x80\\x99s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the weakness of the position. There is no help for it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut access to him,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, â\\x80\\x9cif it should go ill before the Tribunal, will not save him.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI never said it would.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late, and his tears fell.  â\\x80\\x9cYou are a good man and a true friend,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, in an altered voice. â\\x80\\x9cForgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune, however.â\\x80\\x9d  Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch, that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.  â\\x80\\x9cTo return to poor Darnay,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it.  â\\x80\\x9cShe might think a thousand things,â\\x80\\x9d Carton said, â\\x80\\x9cand any of them would only add to her trouble. Donâ\\x80\\x99t speak of me to her. As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am going now, directly.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you. How does she look?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d  It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It attracted Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s eyes to Cartonâ\\x80\\x99s face, which was turned to the fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which), passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had broken under the weight of his foot.  â\\x80\\x9cI forgot it,â\\x80\\x9d he said.  Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having the expression of prisonersâ\\x80\\x99 faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly reminded of that expression.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, turning to him.  â\\x80\\x9cYes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.â\\x80\\x9d  They were both silent.  â\\x80\\x9cYours is a long life to look back upon, sir?â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, wistfully.  â\\x80\\x9cI am in my seventy-eighth year.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSee what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss you when you leave it empty!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA solitary old bachelor,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. â\\x80\\x9cThere is nobody to weep for me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow can you say that? Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t She weep for you? Wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t her child?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, thank God. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t quite mean what I said.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSurely, surely.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, â\\x80\\x98I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!â\\x80\\x99 your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a few moments, said:  â\\x80\\x9cI should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the days when you sat at your motherâ\\x80\\x99s knee, seem days of very long ago?â\\x80\\x9d  Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:  â\\x80\\x9cTwenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!), and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI understand the feeling!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. â\\x80\\x9cAnd you are the better for it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI hope so.â\\x80\\x9d  Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with his outer coat; â\\x80\\x9cBut you,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, â\\x80\\x9cyou are young.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton. â\\x80\\x9cI am not old, but my young way was never the way to age. Enough of me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd of me, I am sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cAre you going out?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, donâ\\x80\\x99t be uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, unhappily.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a place for me. Take my arm, sir.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s destination. Carton left him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to the prison every day. â\\x80\\x9cShe came out here,â\\x80\\x9d he said, looking about him, â\\x80\\x9cturned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in her steps.â\\x80\\x9d  It was ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.  â\\x80\\x9cGood night, citizen,â\\x80\\x9d said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the man eyed him inquisitively.  â\\x80\\x9cGood night, citizen.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow goes the Republic?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you often go to see him--â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNever.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGo and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself, citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less than two pipes. Word of honour!â\\x80\\x9d  As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.  â\\x80\\x9cBut you are not English,â\\x80\\x9d said the wood-sawyer, â\\x80\\x9cthough you wear English dress?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.  â\\x80\\x9cYou speak like a Frenchman.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am an old student here.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGood night, citizen.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBut go and see that droll dog,â\\x80\\x9d the little man persisted, calling after him. â\\x80\\x9cAnd take a pipe with you!â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of terror--he stopped at a chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop, which the owner was closing with his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.  Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. â\\x80\\x9cWhew!â\\x80\\x9d the chemist whistled softly, as he read it. â\\x80\\x9cHi! hi! hi!â\\x80\\x9d  Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:  â\\x80\\x9cFor you, citizen?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFor me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the consequences of mixing them?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPerfectly.â\\x80\\x9d  Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them, and deliberately left the shop. â\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing more to do,â\\x80\\x9d said he, glancing upward at the moon, â\\x80\\x9cuntil to-morrow. I canâ\\x80\\x99t sleep.â\\x80\\x9d  It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into his road and saw its end.  Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been read at his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him. â\\x80\\x9cI am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.â\\x80\\x9d  In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death, and for to-morrowâ\\x80\\x99s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons, and still of to-morrowâ\\x80\\x99s and to-morrowâ\\x80\\x99s, the chain of association that brought the words home, like a rusty old shipâ\\x80\\x99s anchor from the deep, might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and went on.  With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.  Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over, and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.  â\\x80\\x9cI am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.â\\x80\\x9d  Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he heard them always.  The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died, and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Deathâ\\x80\\x99s dominion.  But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays. And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river sparkled under it.  The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--â\\x80\\x9cLike me.â\\x80\\x9d  A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, â\\x80\\x9cI am the resurrection and the life.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.  The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd. Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there, sitting beside her father.  When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.  Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.  Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.  Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor. No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising, murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.  Charles EvrÃ©monde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles EvrÃ©monde, called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.  To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.  The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?  â\\x80\\x9cOpenly, President.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBy whom?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThree voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGood.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThÃ©rÃ¨se Defarge, his wife.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGood.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAlexandre Manette, physician.â\\x80\\x9d  A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.  â\\x80\\x9cPresident, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCitizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic.â\\x80\\x9d  Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and with warmth resumed.  â\\x80\\x9cIf the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!â\\x80\\x9d  Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together, and restored the usual hand to his mouth.  Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him. This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.  â\\x80\\x9cYou did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI believe so.â\\x80\\x9d  Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: â\\x80\\x9cYou were one of the best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!â\\x80\\x9d  It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, â\\x80\\x9cI defy that bell!â\\x80\\x9d  wherein she was likewise much commended.  â\\x80\\x9cInform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille, citizen.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI knew,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him; â\\x80\\x9cI knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower, when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLet it be read.â\\x80\\x9d  In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as follows.     CHAPTER X. The Substance of the Shadow   â\\x80\\x9cI, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust.  â\\x80\\x9cThese words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.  â\\x80\\x9cOne cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hourâ\\x80\\x99s distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.  â\\x80\\x9cThe carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it.  â\\x80\\x9cI observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You are Doctor Manette?â\\x80\\x99 said one.  â\\x80\\x9cI am.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,â\\x80\\x99 said the other; â\\x80\\x98the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Gentlemen,â\\x80\\x99 I returned, â\\x80\\x98I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98We have been to your residence,â\\x80\\x99 said the first, â\\x80\\x98and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door. They were armed. I was not.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Gentlemen,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. â\\x80\\x98Doctor, your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case, our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to enter the carriage?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cI could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.  â\\x80\\x9cI repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place.          *****  â\\x80\\x9cThe carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.  â\\x80\\x9cThere was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention, for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.  â\\x80\\x9cFrom the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain, lying on a bed.  â\\x80\\x9cThe patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s dress. On one of them, which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.  â\\x80\\x9cI saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the corner caught my sight.  â\\x80\\x9cI turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the words, â\\x80\\x98My husband, my father, and my brother!â\\x80\\x99 and then counted up to twelve, and said, â\\x80\\x98Hush!â\\x80\\x99 For an instant, and no more, she would pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she would repeat the cry, â\\x80\\x98My husband, my father, and my brother!â\\x80\\x99 and would count up to twelve, and say, â\\x80\\x98Hush!â\\x80\\x99 There was no variation in the order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause, in the utterance of these sounds.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98How long,â\\x80\\x99 I asked, â\\x80\\x98has this lasted?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cTo distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It was the elder who replied, â\\x80\\x98Since about this hour last night.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98She has a husband, a father, and a brother?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98A brother.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I do not address her brother?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cHe answered with great contempt, â\\x80\\x98No.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98She has some recent association with the number twelve?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe younger brother impatiently rejoined, â\\x80\\x98With twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98See, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x99 said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, â\\x80\\x98how useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, â\\x80\\x98There is a case of medicines here;â\\x80\\x99 and brought it from a closet, and put it on the table.          *****  â\\x80\\x9cI opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Do you doubt them?â\\x80\\x99 asked the younger brother.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,â\\x80\\x99 I replied, and said no more.  â\\x80\\x9cI made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry, â\\x80\\x98My husband, my father, and my brother!â\\x80\\x99 the counting up to twelve, and â\\x80\\x98Hush!â\\x80\\x99 The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement in the case, was, that my hand upon the suffererâ\\x80\\x99s breast had this much soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular.  â\\x80\\x9cFor the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on, before the elder said:  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98There is another patient.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cI was startled, and asked, â\\x80\\x98Is it a pressing case?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You had better see,â\\x80\\x99 he carelessly answered; and took up a light.          *****  â\\x80\\x9cThe other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.  â\\x80\\x9cOn some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most. He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I am a doctor, my poor fellow,â\\x80\\x99 said I. â\\x80\\x98Let me examine it.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I do not want it examined,â\\x80\\x99 he answered; â\\x80\\x98let it be.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cIt was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away. The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98How has this been done, monsieur?â\\x80\\x99 said I.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him, and has fallen by my brotherâ\\x80\\x99s sword--like a gentleman.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThere was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy, or about his fate.  â\\x80\\x9cThe boyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now slowly moved to me.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes. She--have you seen her, Doctor?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.  â\\x80\\x9cI said, â\\x80\\x98I have seen her.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a tenant of his. We were all tenants of his--that manâ\\x80\\x99s who stands there. The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cIt was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out!â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cI had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not been married many weeks, when that manâ\\x80\\x99s brother saw her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her willing?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe boyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this Bastille; the gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s, all negligent indifference; the peasantâ\\x80\\x99s, all trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him and drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the bell, and died on her bosom.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cNothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his wound.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Then, with that manâ\\x80\\x99s permission and even with his aid, his brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion, for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the tidings home, our fatherâ\\x80\\x99s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be _his_ vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window? It was somewhere here?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust at me with all his skill for his life.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cMy glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s. In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldierâ\\x80\\x99s.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98He is not here,â\\x80\\x99 I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he referred to the brother.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the man who was here? Turn my face to him.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cI did so, raising the boyâ\\x80\\x99s head against my knee. But, invested for the moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Marquis,â\\x80\\x99 said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and his right hand raised, â\\x80\\x98in the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cTwice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down dead.          *****  â\\x80\\x9cWhen I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave.  â\\x80\\x9cI repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words. They were always â\\x80\\x98My husband, my father, and my brother! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Hush!â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThis lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Is she dead?â\\x80\\x99 asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Not dead,â\\x80\\x99 said I; â\\x80\\x98but like to die.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98What strength there is in these common bodies!â\\x80\\x99 he said, looking down at her with some curiosity.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98There is prodigious strength,â\\x80\\x99 I answered him, â\\x80\\x98in sorrow and despair.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cHe first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a subdued voice,  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cI listened to the patientâ\\x80\\x99s breathing, and avoided answering.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Monsieur,â\\x80\\x99 said I, â\\x80\\x98in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.â\\x80\\x99 I was guarded in my answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.  â\\x80\\x9cHer breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.          *****  â\\x80\\x9cI write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.  â\\x80\\x9cShe lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.  â\\x80\\x9cI had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.  â\\x80\\x9cI always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brotherâ\\x80\\x99s (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger brotherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.  â\\x80\\x9cMy patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch, answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.  â\\x80\\x9cThe brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98At last she is dead?â\\x80\\x99 said the elder, when I went in.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98She is dead,â\\x80\\x99 said I.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I congratulate you, my brother,â\\x80\\x99 were his words as he turned round.  â\\x80\\x9cHe had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He now gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it on the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept nothing.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Pray excuse me,â\\x80\\x99 said I. â\\x80\\x98Under the circumstances, no.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThey exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them, and we parted without another word on either side.          *****  â\\x80\\x9cI am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery. I cannot read what I have written with this gaunt hand.  â\\x80\\x9cEarly in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.  â\\x80\\x9cI was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.          *****  â\\x80\\x9cI am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful.  â\\x80\\x9cThe lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. EvrÃ©monde. I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately.  â\\x80\\x9cMy memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected, and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s share in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl was dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in secret, a womanâ\\x80\\x99s sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.  â\\x80\\x9cShe had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both.          *****  â\\x80\\x9cThese scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning, yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.  â\\x80\\x9cShe was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98For his sake, Doctor,â\\x80\\x99 she said, pointing to him in tears, â\\x80\\x98I would do all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him. What I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the sister can be discovered.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cShe kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, â\\x80\\x98It is for thine own dear sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?â\\x80\\x99 The child answered her bravely, â\\x80\\x98Yes!â\\x80\\x99 I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and went away caressing him. I never saw her more.  â\\x80\\x9cAs she had mentioned her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s name in the faith that I knew it, I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.  â\\x80\\x9cThat night, the last night of the year, towards nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock, a man in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart! My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.  â\\x80\\x9cAn urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain me, he had a coach in waiting.  â\\x80\\x9cIt brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot. Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living grave.  â\\x80\\x9cIf it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven and to earth.â\\x80\\x9d  A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.  Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register. The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.  And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the peopleâ\\x80\\x99s altar. Therefore when the President said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of human sympathy.  â\\x80\\x9cMuch influence around him, has that Doctor?â\\x80\\x9d murmured Madame Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance. â\\x80\\x9cSave him now, my Doctor, save him!â\\x80\\x9d  At every jurymanâ\\x80\\x99s vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and roar.  Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!     CHAPTER XI. Dusk   The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.  The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors, the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the courtâ\\x80\\x99s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation.  â\\x80\\x9cIf I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!â\\x80\\x9d  There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, â\\x80\\x9cLet her embrace him then; it is but a moment.â\\x80\\x9d It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.  â\\x80\\x9cFarewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!â\\x80\\x9d  They were her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s words, as he held her to his bosom.  â\\x80\\x9cI can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: donâ\\x80\\x99t suffer for me. A parting blessing for our child.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy husband. No! A moment!â\\x80\\x9d He was tearing himself apart from her. â\\x80\\x9cWe shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.â\\x80\\x9d  Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:  â\\x80\\x9cNo, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know, now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!â\\x80\\x9d  Her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.  â\\x80\\x9cIt could not be otherwise,â\\x80\\x9d said the prisoner. â\\x80\\x9cAll things have worked together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor motherâ\\x80\\x99s trust that first brought my fatal presence near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven bless you!â\\x80\\x9d  As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile. As he went out at the prisonersâ\\x80\\x99 door, she turned, laid her head lovingly on her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his feet.  Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved, Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head. Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a flush of pride in it.  â\\x80\\x9cShall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.â\\x80\\x9d  He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat beside the driver.  When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her.  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t recall her to herself,â\\x80\\x9d he said, softly, to the latter, â\\x80\\x9cshe is better so. Donâ\\x80\\x99t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!â\\x80\\x9d cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. â\\x80\\x9cNow that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?â\\x80\\x9d  He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.  â\\x80\\x9cBefore I go,â\\x80\\x9d he said, and paused--â\\x80\\x9cI may kiss her?â\\x80\\x9d  It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, â\\x80\\x9cA life you love.â\\x80\\x9d  When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:  â\\x80\\x9cYou had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.â\\x80\\x9d He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly.  â\\x80\\x9cTry them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI intend to try. I will not rest a moment.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before now--though never,â\\x80\\x9d he added, with a smile and a sigh together, â\\x80\\x9csuch great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI will go,â\\x80\\x9d said Doctor Manette, â\\x80\\x9cto the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will write too, and--But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and no one will be accessible until dark.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cImmediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from this.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I go to Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from our friend or from yourself?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMay you prosper!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.  â\\x80\\x9cI have no hope,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.  â\\x80\\x9cNor have I.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any manâ\\x80\\x99s to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t despond,â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, very gently; â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t grieve. I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think â\\x80\\x98his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted,â\\x80\\x99 and that might trouble her.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, â\\x80\\x9cyou are right. But he will perish; there is no real hope.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes. He will perish: there is no real hope,â\\x80\\x9d echoed Carton.  And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.     CHAPTER XII. Darkness   Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. â\\x80\\x9cAt Tellsonâ\\x80\\x99s banking-house at nine,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a musing face. â\\x80\\x9cShall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care! Let me think it out!â\\x80\\x9d  Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was confirmed. â\\x80\\x9cIt is best,â\\x80\\x9d he said, finally resolved, â\\x80\\x9cthat these people should know there is such a man as I here.â\\x80\\x9d And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine.  Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s hearth like a man who had done with it.  It was as late as seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s, and went in.  There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment.  As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.  He repeated what he had already said.  â\\x80\\x9cEnglish?â\\x80\\x9d asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows.  After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign accent. â\\x80\\x9cYes, madame, yes. I am English!â\\x80\\x9d  Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning, he heard her say, â\\x80\\x9cI swear to you, like EvrÃ©monde!â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.  â\\x80\\x9cHow?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGood evening.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh! Good evening, citizen,â\\x80\\x9d filling his glass. â\\x80\\x9cAh! and good wine. I drink to the Republic.â\\x80\\x9d  Defarge went back to the counter, and said, â\\x80\\x9cCertainly, a little like.â\\x80\\x9d  Madame sternly retorted, â\\x80\\x9cI tell you a good deal like.â\\x80\\x9d Jacques Three pacifically remarked, â\\x80\\x9cHe is so much in your mind, see you, madame.â\\x80\\x9d  The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, â\\x80\\x9cYes, my faith! And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to-morrow!â\\x80\\x9d  Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed their conversation.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is true what madame says,â\\x80\\x9d observed Jacques Three. â\\x80\\x9cWhy stop? There is great force in that. Why stop?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d reasoned Defarge, â\\x80\\x9cbut one must stop somewhere. After all, the question is still where?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAt extermination,â\\x80\\x9d said madame.  â\\x80\\x9cMagnificent!â\\x80\\x9d croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly approved.  â\\x80\\x9cExtermination is good doctrine, my wife,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, rather troubled; â\\x80\\x9cin general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when the paper was read.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have observed his face!â\\x80\\x9d repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily. â\\x80\\x9cYes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd you have observed, my wife,â\\x80\\x9d said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner, â\\x80\\x9cthe anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have observed his daughter,â\\x80\\x9d repeated madame; â\\x80\\x9cyes, I have observed his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my finger--!â\\x80\\x9d She seemed to raise it (the listenerâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were always on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the axe had dropped.  â\\x80\\x9cThe citizeness is superb!â\\x80\\x9d croaked the Juryman.  â\\x80\\x9cShe is an Angel!â\\x80\\x9d said The Vengeance, and embraced her.  â\\x80\\x9cAs to thee,â\\x80\\x9d pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, â\\x80\\x9cif it depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this man even now.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d protested Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cNot if to lift this glass would do it! But I would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSee you then, Jacques,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; â\\x80\\x9cand see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register, doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is so,â\\x80\\x9d assented Defarge, without being asked.  â\\x80\\x9cIn the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is so,â\\x80\\x9d assented Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cThat night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is that so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is so,â\\x80\\x9d assented Defarge again.  â\\x80\\x9cI communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, â\\x80\\x98Defarge, I was brought up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured by the two EvrÃ©monde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things descends to me!â\\x80\\x99 Ask him, is that so.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is so,â\\x80\\x9d assented Defarge once more.  â\\x80\\x9cThen tell Wind and Fire where to stop,â\\x80\\x9d returned madame; â\\x80\\x9cbut donâ\\x80\\x99t tell me.â\\x80\\x9d  Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. â\\x80\\x9cTell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!â\\x80\\x9d  Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road. The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and deep.  But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present himself in Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s room again, where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the banking-house towards four oâ\\x80\\x99clock. She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been more than five hours gone: where could he be?  Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight. In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.  He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and brought none. Where could he be?  They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was lost.  Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.  â\\x80\\x9cI cannot find it,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cand I must have it. Where is it?â\\x80\\x9d  His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.  â\\x80\\x9cWhere is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I canâ\\x80\\x99t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must finish those shoes.â\\x80\\x9d  They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.  â\\x80\\x9cCome, come!â\\x80\\x9d said he, in a whimpering miserable way; â\\x80\\x9clet me get to work. Give me my work.â\\x80\\x9d  Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the ground, like a distracted child.  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t torture a poor forlorn wretch,â\\x80\\x9d he implored them, with a dreadful cry; â\\x80\\x9cbut give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are not done to-night?â\\x80\\x9d  Lost, utterly lost!  It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him, that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.  Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:  â\\x80\\x9cThe last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me? Donâ\\x80\\x99t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do not doubt it,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Lorry. â\\x80\\x9cSay on.â\\x80\\x9d  The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night.  Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his dayâ\\x80\\x99s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. â\\x80\\x9cWe should look at this!â\\x80\\x9d he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cThank _God!_â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.  â\\x80\\x9cA moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,â\\x80\\x9d he put his hand in his coat, and took another paper from it, â\\x80\\x9cthat is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton, an Englishman?â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.  â\\x80\\x9cKeep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the frontier! You see?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil, yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; donâ\\x80\\x99t stay to look; put it up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to think, will be.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey are not in danger?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that womanâ\\x80\\x99s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by Madame Defarge as to his having seen Herâ\\x80\\x9d--he never mentioned Lucieâ\\x80\\x99s name--â\\x80\\x9cmaking signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will involve her life--and perhaps her childâ\\x80\\x99s--and perhaps her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s--for both have been seen with her at that place. Donâ\\x80\\x99t look so horrified. You will save them all.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHeaven grant I may, Carton! But how?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards; more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSo attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for the moment I lose sight,â\\x80\\x9d touching the back of the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s chair, â\\x80\\x9ceven of this distress.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt shall be done!â\\x80\\x9d  His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the flame, and was as quick as youth.  â\\x80\\x9cYou are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man? Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head beside her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s cheerfully.â\\x80\\x9d He faltered for an instant; then went on as before. â\\x80\\x9cFor the sake of her child and her father, press upon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell her that it was her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s last arrangement. Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am sure of it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage. The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and then for England!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand, â\\x80\\x9cit does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBy the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNothing, Carton.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cRemember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!â\\x80\\x9d  Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even put the old manâ\\x80\\x99s hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it--outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell.     CHAPTER XIII. Fifty-two   In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart.  Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction.  Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him, that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail him nothing.  Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.  But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So, by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.  Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished.  He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s and uncleâ\\x80\\x99s responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.  To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending.  To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs. That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so full of the others, that he never once thought of him.  He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.  But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it flashed upon his mind, â\\x80\\x9cthis is the day of my death!â\\x80\\x9d  Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking thoughts, which was very difficult to master.  He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.  The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over. He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself and for them.  Twelve gone for ever.  He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.  Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered self-possession, he thought, â\\x80\\x9cThere is but another now,â\\x80\\x9d and turned to walk again.  Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.  The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: â\\x80\\x9cHe has never seen me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose no time!â\\x80\\x9d  The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.  There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and it was his real grasp.  â\\x80\\x9cOf all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?â\\x80\\x9d he said.  â\\x80\\x9cI could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You are notâ\\x80\\x9d--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--â\\x80\\x9ca prisoner?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her--your wife, dear Darnay.â\\x80\\x9d  The prisoner wrung his hand.  â\\x80\\x9cI bring you a request from her.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well remember.â\\x80\\x9d  The prisoner turned his face partly aside.  â\\x80\\x9cYou have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have no time to tell you. You must comply with it--take off those boots you wear, and draw on these of mine.â\\x80\\x9d  There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner. Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.  â\\x80\\x9cDraw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to them. Quick!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCarton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You will only die with me. It is madness.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like this of mine!â\\x80\\x9d  With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action, that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him. The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.  â\\x80\\x9cCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt was when you came in.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!â\\x80\\x9d  Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.  â\\x80\\x9cWrite exactly as I speak.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTo whom do I address it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTo no one.â\\x80\\x9d Carton still had his hand in his breast.  â\\x80\\x9cDo I date it?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d  The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98If you remember,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, dictating, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d  He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something.  â\\x80\\x9cHave you written â\\x80\\x98forget themâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d Carton asked.  â\\x80\\x9cI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo; I am not armed.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it in your hand?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.â\\x80\\x9d He dictated again. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writerâ\\x80\\x99s face.  The pen dropped from Darnayâ\\x80\\x99s fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat vapour is that?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.  â\\x80\\x9cVapour?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSomething that crossed me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!â\\x80\\x9d  As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him.  â\\x80\\x9cHurry, hurry!â\\x80\\x9d  The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98If it had been otherwise;â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Cartonâ\\x80\\x99s hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d the hand was at the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s face; â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs.  Cartonâ\\x80\\x99s hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Cartonâ\\x80\\x99s hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Cartonâ\\x80\\x99s left arm caught him round the waist. For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on the ground.  Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he softly called, â\\x80\\x9cEnter there! Come in!â\\x80\\x9d and the Spy presented himself.  â\\x80\\x9cYou see?â\\x80\\x9d said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: â\\x80\\x9cis your hazard very great?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMr. Carton,â\\x80\\x9d the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, â\\x80\\x9cmy hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of your bargain.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t fear me. I will be true to the death.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHave no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and take me to the coach.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou?â\\x80\\x9d said the Spy nervously.  â\\x80\\x9cHim, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOf course.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands. Quick! Call assistance!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou swear not to betray me?â\\x80\\x9d said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a last moment.  â\\x80\\x9cMan, man!â\\x80\\x9d returned Carton, stamping his foot; â\\x80\\x9chave I sworn by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!â\\x80\\x9d  The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.  â\\x80\\x9cHow, then?â\\x80\\x9d said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. â\\x80\\x9cSo afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte Guillotine?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cA good patriot,â\\x80\\x9d said the other, â\\x80\\x9ccould hardly have been more afflicted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.â\\x80\\x9d  They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.  â\\x80\\x9cThe time is short, EvrÃ©monde,â\\x80\\x9d said the Spy, in a warning voice.  â\\x80\\x9cI know it well,â\\x80\\x9d answered Carton. â\\x80\\x9cBe careful of my friend, I entreat you, and leave me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCome, then, my children,â\\x80\\x9d said Barsad. â\\x80\\x9cLift him, and come away!â\\x80\\x9d  The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.  Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely saying, â\\x80\\x9cFollow me, EvrÃ©monde!â\\x80\\x9d and he followed into a large dark room, at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion; but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking fixedly at the ground.  As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him, as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.  â\\x80\\x9cCitizen EvrÃ©monde,â\\x80\\x9d she said, touching him with her cold hand. â\\x80\\x9cI am a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.â\\x80\\x9d  He murmured for answer: â\\x80\\x9cTrue. I forget what you were accused of?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPlots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?â\\x80\\x9d  The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears started from his eyes.  â\\x80\\x9cI am not afraid to die, Citizen EvrÃ©monde, but I have done nothing. I am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be, Citizen EvrÃ©monde. Such a poor weak little creature!â\\x80\\x9d  As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.  â\\x80\\x9cI heard you were released, Citizen EvrÃ©monde. I hoped it was true?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt was. But, I was again taken and condemned.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf I may ride with you, Citizen EvrÃ©monde, will you let me hold your hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me more courage.â\\x80\\x9d  As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young fingers, and touched his lips.  â\\x80\\x9cAre you dying for him?â\\x80\\x9d she whispered.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd his wife and child. Hush! Yes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cO you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.â\\x80\\x9d          *****  The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.  â\\x80\\x9cWho goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!â\\x80\\x9d  The papers are handed out, and read.  â\\x80\\x9cAlexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?â\\x80\\x9d  This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man pointed out.  â\\x80\\x9cApparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?â\\x80\\x9d  Greatly too much for him.  â\\x80\\x9cHah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is she?â\\x80\\x9d  This is she.  â\\x80\\x9cApparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of EvrÃ©monde; is it not?â\\x80\\x9d  It is.  â\\x80\\x9cHah! EvrÃ©monde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child. English. This is she?â\\x80\\x9d  She and no other.  â\\x80\\x9cKiss me, child of EvrÃ©monde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican; something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton. Advocate. English. Which is he?â\\x80\\x9d  He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.  â\\x80\\x9cApparently the English advocate is in a swoon?â\\x80\\x9d  It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic.  â\\x80\\x9cIs that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window. Jarvis Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am he. Necessarily, being the last.â\\x80\\x9d  It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.  â\\x80\\x9cBehold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOne can depart, citizen?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOne can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!â\\x80\\x9d  These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.  â\\x80\\x9cAre we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?â\\x80\\x9d  asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.  â\\x80\\x9cIt would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much; it would rouse suspicion.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLook back, look back, and see if we are pursued!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.â\\x80\\x9d  Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing anything but stopping.  Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes, avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven, no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush! the posting-house.  Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results. All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.  At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their haunches. We are pursued?  â\\x80\\x9cHo! Within the carriage there. Speak then!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.  â\\x80\\x9cHow many did they say?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do not understand you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9c--At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFifty-two.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!â\\x80\\x9d  The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him, by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.  The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.     CHAPTER XIV. The Knitting Done   In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.  â\\x80\\x9cBut our Defarge,â\\x80\\x9d said Jacques Three, â\\x80\\x9cis undoubtedly a good Republican? Eh?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere is no better,â\\x80\\x9d the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes, â\\x80\\x9cin France.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cPeace, little Vengeance,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenantâ\\x80\\x99s lips, â\\x80\\x9chear me speak. My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is a great pity,â\\x80\\x9d croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; â\\x80\\x9cit is not quite like a good citizen; it is a thing to regret.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSee you,â\\x80\\x9d said madame, â\\x80\\x9cI care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to me. But, the EvrÃ©monde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow the husband and father.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShe has a fine head for it,â\\x80\\x9d croaked Jacques Three. â\\x80\\x9cI have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up.â\\x80\\x9d Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.  Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.  â\\x80\\x9cThe child also,â\\x80\\x9d observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, â\\x80\\x9chas golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child there. It is a pretty sight!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIn a word,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, â\\x80\\x9cI cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they might escape.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat must never be,â\\x80\\x9d croaked Jacques Three; â\\x80\\x9cno one must escape. We have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIn a word,â\\x80\\x9d Madame Defarge went on, â\\x80\\x9cmy husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself, therefore. Come hither, little citizen.â\\x80\\x9d  The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.  â\\x80\\x9cTouching those signals, little citizen,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, sternly, â\\x80\\x9cthat she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, why not!â\\x80\\x9d cried the sawyer. â\\x80\\x9cEvery day, in all weathers, from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.â\\x80\\x9d  He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen.  â\\x80\\x9cClearly plots,â\\x80\\x9d said Jacques Three. â\\x80\\x9cTransparently!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere is no doubt of the Jury?â\\x80\\x9d inquired Madame Defarge, letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.  â\\x80\\x9cRely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my fellow-Jurymen.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNow, let me see,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, pondering again. â\\x80\\x9cYet once more! Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can I spare him?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe would count as one head,â\\x80\\x9d observed Jacques Three, in a low voice. â\\x80\\x9cWe really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe was signalling with her when I saw her,â\\x80\\x9d argued Madame Defarge; â\\x80\\x9cI cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a bad witness.â\\x80\\x9d  The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestial witness.  â\\x80\\x9cHe must take his chance,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cNo, I cannot spare him! You are engaged at three oâ\\x80\\x99clock; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed.--You?â\\x80\\x9d  The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s head) of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.  â\\x80\\x9cI,â\\x80\\x9d said madame, â\\x80\\x9cam equally engaged at the same place. After it is over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we will give information against these people at my Section.â\\x80\\x9d  The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.  Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:  â\\x80\\x9cShe will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies. I will go to her.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Jacques Three, rapturously. â\\x80\\x9cAh, my cherished!â\\x80\\x9d cried The Vengeance; and embraced her.  â\\x80\\x9cTake you my knitting,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, placing it in her lieutenantâ\\x80\\x99s hands, â\\x80\\x9cand have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual, to-day.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI willingly obey the orders of my Chief,â\\x80\\x9d said The Vengeance with alacrity, and kissing her cheek. â\\x80\\x9cYou will not be late?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI shall be there before the commencement.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,â\\x80\\x9d said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the street, â\\x80\\x9cbefore the tumbrils arrive!â\\x80\\x9d  Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.  There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her.  It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there.  Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.  Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorryâ\\x80\\x99s attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there. Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period. Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.  Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.  â\\x80\\x9cNow what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken suspicion.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy opinion, miss,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Cruncher, â\\x80\\x9cis as youâ\\x80\\x99re right. Likewise wot Iâ\\x80\\x99ll stand by you, right or wrong.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, wildly crying, â\\x80\\x9cthat I am incapable of forming any plan. Are _you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cRespectinâ\\x80\\x99 a future spear oâ\\x80\\x99 life, miss,â\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Cruncher, â\\x80\\x9cI hope so. Respectinâ\\x80\\x99 any present use oâ\\x80\\x99 this here blessed old head oâ\\x80\\x99 mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice oâ\\x80\\x99 two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh, for gracious sake!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, â\\x80\\x9crecord them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFirst,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage, â\\x80\\x9cthem poor things well out oâ\\x80\\x99 this, never no more will I do it, never no more!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,â\\x80\\x9d returned Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cthat you never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo, miss,â\\x80\\x9d returned Jerry, â\\x80\\x9cit shall not be named to you. Second: them poor things well out oâ\\x80\\x99 this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s flopping, never no more!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, â\\x80\\x9cI have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence.--O my poor darlings!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI go so far as to say, miss, moreover,â\\x80\\x9d proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--â\\x80\\x9cand let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my opinions respectinâ\\x80\\x99 flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThere, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,â\\x80\\x9d cried the distracted Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cand I hope she finds it answering her expectations.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cForbid it,â\\x80\\x9d proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, â\\x80\\x9cas anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t all flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get â\\x80\\x99em out oâ\\x80\\x99 this here dismal risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!â\\x80\\x9d This was Mr. Cruncherâ\\x80\\x99s conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.  And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.  â\\x80\\x9cIf we ever get back to our native land,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cyou may rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!â\\x80\\x9d  Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.  â\\x80\\x9cIf you were to go before,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cand stop the vehicle and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t that be best?â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.  â\\x80\\x9cWhere could you wait for me?â\\x80\\x9d asked Miss Pross.  Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed.  â\\x80\\x9cBy the cathedral door,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross. â\\x80\\x9cWould it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo, miss,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Cruncher.  â\\x80\\x9cThen, like the best of men,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cgo to the posting-house straight, and make that change.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am doubtful,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, â\\x80\\x9cabout leaving of you, you see. We donâ\\x80\\x99t know what may happen.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHeaven knows we donâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d returned Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cbut have no fear for me. Take me in at the cathedral, at Three oâ\\x80\\x99Clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!â\\x80\\x9d  This exordium, and Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed.  The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.  Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.  The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood, those feet had come to meet that water.  Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, â\\x80\\x9cThe wife of EvrÃ©monde; where is she?â\\x80\\x9d  It flashed upon Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.  Madame Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.  â\\x80\\x9cYou might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, in her breathing. â\\x80\\x9cNevertheless, you shall not get the better of me. I am an Englishwoman.â\\x80\\x9d  Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that Miss Pross was the familyâ\\x80\\x99s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the familyâ\\x80\\x99s malevolent enemy.  â\\x80\\x9cOn my way yonder,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, â\\x80\\x9cwhere they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I wish to see her.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI know that your intentions are evil,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cand you may depend upon it, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll hold my own against them.â\\x80\\x9d  Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the otherâ\\x80\\x99s words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant.  â\\x80\\x9cIt will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge. â\\x80\\x9cGood patriots will know what that means. Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf those eyes of yours were bed-winches,â\\x80\\x9d returned Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cand I was an English four-poster, they shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t loose a splinter of me. No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.â\\x80\\x9d  Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught.  â\\x80\\x9cWoman imbecile and pig-like!â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge, frowning. â\\x80\\x9cI take no answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!â\\x80\\x9d  This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.  â\\x80\\x9cI little thought,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cthat I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it.â\\x80\\x9d  Neither of them for a single moment released the otherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.  â\\x80\\x9cI am a Briton,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cI am desperate. I donâ\\x80\\x99t care an English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my Ladybird. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!â\\x80\\x9d  Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath. Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.  But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. â\\x80\\x9cHa, ha!â\\x80\\x9d she laughed, â\\x80\\x9cyou poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor.â\\x80\\x9d Then she raised her voice and called out, â\\x80\\x9cCitizen Doctor! Wife of EvrÃ©monde! Child of EvrÃ©monde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!â\\x80\\x9d  Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Prossâ\\x80\\x99s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.  â\\x80\\x9cThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNever!â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer.  â\\x80\\x9cIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge to herself.  â\\x80\\x9cAs long as you donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross to herself; â\\x80\\x9cand you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,â\\x80\\x9d said Madame Defarge.  â\\x80\\x9cWe are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross.  Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight. It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.  Soon, Madame Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist. â\\x80\\x9cIt is under my arm,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, â\\x80\\x9cyou shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!â\\x80\\x9d  Madame Defargeâ\\x80\\x99s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood alone--blinded with smoke.  All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground.  In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.  By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a hundred ways.  In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.  â\\x80\\x9cIs there any noise in the streets?â\\x80\\x9d she asked him.  â\\x80\\x9cThe usual noises,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect.  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t hear you,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you say?â\\x80\\x9d  It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could not hear him. â\\x80\\x9cSo Iâ\\x80\\x99ll nod my head,â\\x80\\x9d thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, â\\x80\\x9cat all events sheâ\\x80\\x99ll see that.â\\x80\\x9d And she did.  â\\x80\\x9cIs there any noise in the streets now?â\\x80\\x9d asked Miss Pross again, presently.  Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.  â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t hear it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cGone deaf in an hour?â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind much disturbed; â\\x80\\x9cwotâ\\x80\\x99s come to her?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI feel,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, â\\x80\\x9cas if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBlest if she ainâ\\x80\\x99t in a queer condition!â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, more and more disturbed. â\\x80\\x9cWot can she have been a takinâ\\x80\\x99, to keep her courage up? Hark! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI can hear,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, â\\x80\\x9cnothing. O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf she donâ\\x80\\x99t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their journeyâ\\x80\\x99s end,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.â\\x80\\x9d  And indeed she never did.     CHAPTER XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever   Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six tumbrils carry the dayâ\\x80\\x99s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.  Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants! No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. â\\x80\\x9cIf thou be changed into this shape by the will of God,â\\x80\\x9d say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, â\\x80\\x9cthen remain so! But, if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!â\\x80\\x9d  Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.  As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward. So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight; then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.  Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes, and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.  There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils, and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily touch his face, his arms being bound.  On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there. He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, â\\x80\\x9cHas he sacrificed me?â\\x80\\x9d when his face clears, as he looks into the third.  â\\x80\\x9cWhich is EvrÃ©monde?â\\x80\\x9d says a man behind him.  â\\x80\\x9cThat. At the back there.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWith his hand in the girlâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  The man cries, â\\x80\\x9cDown, EvrÃ©monde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats! Down, EvrÃ©monde!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHush, hush!â\\x80\\x9d the Spy entreats him, timidly.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd why not, citizen?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHe is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more. Let him be at peace.â\\x80\\x9d  But the man continuing to exclaim, â\\x80\\x9cDown, EvrÃ©monde!â\\x80\\x9d the face of EvrÃ©monde is for a moment turned towards him. EvrÃ©monde then sees the Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.  The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.  â\\x80\\x9cThÃ©rÃ¨se!â\\x80\\x9d she cries, in her shrill tones. â\\x80\\x9cWho has seen her? ThÃ©rÃ¨se Defarge!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShe never missed before,â\\x80\\x9d says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.  â\\x80\\x9cNo; nor will she miss now,â\\x80\\x9d cries The Vengeance, petulantly. â\\x80\\x9cThÃ©rÃ¨se.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cLouder,â\\x80\\x9d the woman recommends.  Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her, lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her!  â\\x80\\x9cBad Fortune!â\\x80\\x9d cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, â\\x80\\x9cand here are the tumbrils! And EvrÃ©monde will be despatched in a wink, and she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!â\\x80\\x9d  As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak, count One.  The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!--And the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.  The supposed EvrÃ©monde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into his face and thanks him.  â\\x80\\x9cBut for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by Heaven.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOr you to me,â\\x80\\x9d says Sydney Carton. â\\x80\\x9cKeep your eyes upon me, dear child, and mind no other object.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let it go, if they are rapid.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThey will be rapid. Fear not!â\\x80\\x9d  The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in her bosom.  â\\x80\\x9cBrave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTell me what it is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a farmerâ\\x80\\x99s house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I tell her! It is better as it is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes: better as it is.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor, and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may live a long time: she may even live to be old.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhat then, my gentle sister?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you think:â\\x80\\x9d the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble: â\\x80\\x9cthat it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the moment come?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other. The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before him--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.  â\\x80\\x9cI am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.â\\x80\\x9d  The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away. Twenty-Three.          *****  They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the peacefullest manâ\\x80\\x99s face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic.  One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:  â\\x80\\x9cI see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.  â\\x80\\x9cI see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their friend, in ten yearsâ\\x80\\x99 time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward.  â\\x80\\x9cI see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the otherâ\\x80\\x99s soul, than I was in the souls of both.  â\\x80\\x9cI see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him, fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--then fair to look upon, with not a trace of this dayâ\\x80\\x99s disfigurement--and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.â\\x80\\x9d     *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A TALE OF TWO CITIES ***  ***** This file should be named 98-0.txt or 98-0.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:     https://www.gutenberg.org/9/98/  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org  Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.

Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact  Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.  I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. Thereâ\\x80\\x94for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigatorsâ\\x80\\x94there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.  These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purposeâ\\x80\\x94a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomasâ\\x80\\x99 library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.  These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.  Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.  And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.  This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in fursâ\\x80\\x94a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.  I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.  Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.  Your affectionate brother,  R. Walton     Letter 2  _To Mrs. Saville, England._  Archangel, 28th March, 17â\\x80\\x94.   How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.  But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomasâ\\x80\\x99 books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.  Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.  The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young womanâ\\x80\\x99s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a noble fellow!â\\x80\\x9d you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.  Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.  I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to â\\x80\\x9cthe land of mist and snow,â\\x80\\x9d but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the â\\x80\\x9cAncient Mariner.â\\x80\\x9d You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industriousâ\\x80\\x94painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labourâ\\x80\\x94but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore.  But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.  Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.  Your affectionate brother,  Robert Walton     Letter 3  _To Mrs. Saville, England._  July 7th, 17â\\x80\\x94.   My dear Sister,  I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safeâ\\x80\\x94and well advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.  No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.  Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.  But success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?  My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!  R.W.     Letter 4   _To Mrs. Saville, England._  August 5th, 17â\\x80\\x94.  So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.  Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.  About two oâ\\x80\\x99clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.  This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.  About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.  In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the master said, â\\x80\\x9cHere is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.â\\x80\\x9d  On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. â\\x80\\x9cBefore I come on board your vessel,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cwill you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?â\\x80\\x9d  You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.  Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.  Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.  When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.  His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, â\\x80\\x9cTo seek one who fled from me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThen I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.â\\x80\\x9d  This aroused the strangerâ\\x80\\x99s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dÃ¦mon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, â\\x80\\x9cI have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cCertainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.â\\x80\\x9d  Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.  From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.  Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.  I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.  I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.     August 13th, 17â\\x80\\x94.   My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.  He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One manâ\\x80\\x99s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listenerâ\\x80\\x99s countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: â\\x80\\x9cUnhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!â\\x80\\x9d  Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.  Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.  â\\x80\\x9cI agree with you,â\\x80\\x9d replied the stranger; â\\x80\\x9cwe are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselvesâ\\x80\\x94such a friend ought to beâ\\x80\\x94do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But Iâ\\x80\\x94I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.â\\x80\\x9d  As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.  Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.  Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.     August 19th, 17â\\x80\\x94.   Yesterday the stranger said to me, â\\x80\\x9cYou may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.â\\x80\\x9d  You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer.  â\\x80\\x9cI thank you,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, â\\x80\\x9cfor your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; â\\x80\\x9cbut you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.â\\x80\\x9d  He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lipsâ\\x80\\x94with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked itâ\\x80\\x94thus!     Chapter 1   I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.  As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.  Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchantâ\\x80\\x99s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.  His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.  Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufortâ\\x80\\x99s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.  There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense of justice in my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.  From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My motherâ\\x80\\x99s tender caresses and my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something betterâ\\x80\\x94their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.  For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passionâ\\x80\\x94remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relievedâ\\x80\\x94for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.  The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italyâ\\x80\\x94one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.  When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherubâ\\x80\\x94a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parentsâ\\x80\\x99 houseâ\\x80\\x94my more than sisterâ\\x80\\x94the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.  Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, â\\x80\\x9cI have a pretty present for my Victorâ\\x80\\x94tomorrow he shall have it.â\\x80\\x9d And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mineâ\\x80\\x94mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to meâ\\x80\\x94my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.     Chapter 2   We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home â\\x80\\x94the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summersâ\\x80\\x94she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.  On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.  No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.  My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.  Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clervalâ\\x80\\x94could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.  I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.  Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, â\\x80\\x9cAh! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.â\\x80\\x9d  If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.  When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boyâ\\x80\\x99s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.  The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.  But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a childâ\\x80\\x99s blindness, added to a studentâ\\x80\\x99s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopherâ\\x80\\x99s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!  Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.  When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.  Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.  Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my lifeâ\\x80\\x94the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.  It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.     Chapter 3   When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurredâ\\x80\\x94an omen, as it were, of my future misery.  Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemperâ\\x80\\x94Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. â\\x80\\x9cMy children,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cmy firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.â\\x80\\x9d  She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for everâ\\x80\\x94that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.  My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.  She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.  The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.  We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word â\\x80\\x9cFarewell!â\\x80\\x9d It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morningâ\\x80\\x99s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all thereâ\\x80\\x94my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.  I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasureâ\\x80\\x94I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were â\\x80\\x9cold familiar faces,â\\x80\\x9d but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.  Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.  I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.  The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. Chanceâ\\x80\\x94or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s doorâ\\x80\\x94led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared. â\\x80\\x9cHave you,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9creally spent your time in studying such nonsense?â\\x80\\x9d  I replied in the affirmative. â\\x80\\x9cEvery minute,â\\x80\\x9d continued M. Krempe with warmth, â\\x80\\x9cevery instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.â\\x80\\x9d  So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.  I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.  Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.  Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget:  â\\x80\\x9cThe ancient teachers of this science,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cpromised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.â\\x80\\x9d  Such were the professorâ\\x80\\x99s wordsâ\\x80\\x94rather let me say such the words of the fateâ\\x80\\x94enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankensteinâ\\x80\\x94more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.  I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morningâ\\x80\\x99s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternightâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts were as a dream. There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said that â\\x80\\x9cThese were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.â\\x80\\x9d I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.  â\\x80\\x9cI am happy,â\\x80\\x9d said M. Waldman, â\\x80\\x9cto have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.â\\x80\\x9d  He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave.  Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.     Chapter 4   From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.  As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.  One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon meâ\\x80\\x94a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.  Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.  The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.  I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.  When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.  No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.  These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.  The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: â\\x80\\x9cI know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.â\\x80\\x9d  I knew well therefore what would be my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.  I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, CÃ¦sar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.  But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.  My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leavesâ\\x80\\x94sights which before always yielded me supreme delightâ\\x80\\x94so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.     Chapter 5   It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.  How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.  The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretchâ\\x80\\x94the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.  Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.  I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!  Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.  I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:    Like one who, on a lonely road,  Doth walk in fear and dread,  And, having once turned round, walks on,  And turns no more his head;  Because he knows a frightful fiend  Doth close behind him tread.    [Coleridgeâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cAncient Mariner.â\\x80\\x9d]    Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Frankenstein,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed he, â\\x80\\x9chow glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!â\\x80\\x9d  Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. â\\x80\\x9cYou may easily believe,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9chow great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: â\\x80\\x98I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.â\\x80\\x99 But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cVery well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, â\\x80\\x9cI did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free.â\\x80\\x9d  I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.  We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Victor,â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cwhat, for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo not ask me,â\\x80\\x9d cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; â\\x80\\x9c_he_ can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!â\\x80\\x9d I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.  Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.  This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learned that, knowing my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.  But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.  By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.  â\\x80\\x9cDearest Clerval,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed I, â\\x80\\x9chow kind, how very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?â\\x80\\x9d  I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?  â\\x80\\x9cCompose yourself,â\\x80\\x9d said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, â\\x80\\x9cI will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIs that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 6   Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own Elizabeth:  â\\x80\\x9cMy dearest Cousin,  â\\x80\\x9cYou have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are forbidden to writeâ\\x80\\x94to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.  â\\x80\\x9cGet wellâ\\x80\\x94and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly. Your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.  â\\x80\\x9cLittle alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountainsâ\\x80\\x94they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.  â\\x80\\x9cJustine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelicaâ\\x80\\x94she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.  â\\x80\\x9cOne by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her motherâ\\x80\\x99s house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.  â\\x80\\x9cI must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.  â\\x80\\x9cNow, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody.  â\\x80\\x9cI have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,â\\x80\\x94one lineâ\\x80\\x94one word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write!  â\\x80\\x9cElizabeth Lavenza.   â\\x80\\x9cGeneva, March 18th, 17â\\x80\\x94.â\\x80\\x9d    â\\x80\\x9cDear, dear Elizabeth!â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: â\\x80\\x9cI will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.â\\x80\\x9d I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.  One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.  M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n the fellow!â\\x80\\x9d cried he; â\\x80\\x9cwhy, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.â\\x80\\x94Ay, ay,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, â\\x80\\x9cM. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.â\\x80\\x9d  M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.  Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,â\\x80\\x94in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!  Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.  The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.  We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.  Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.  We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.     Chapter 7   On my return, I found the following letter from my father:â\\x80\\x94  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Victor,  â\\x80\\x9cYou have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.  â\\x80\\x9cWilliam is dead!â\\x80\\x94that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!  â\\x80\\x9cI will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.  â\\x80\\x9cLast Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.  â\\x80\\x9cThis account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murderâ\\x80\\x99s finger was on his neck.  â\\x80\\x9cHe was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98O God! I have murdered my darling child!â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cShe fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!  â\\x80\\x9cCome, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!  â\\x80\\x9cCome, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.  â\\x80\\x9cYour affectionate and afflicted father,  â\\x80\\x9cAlphonse Frankenstein.    â\\x80\\x9cGeneva, May 12th, 17â\\x80\\x94.â\\x80\\x9d    Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving new from my friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Frankenstein,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, â\\x80\\x9care you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened?â\\x80\\x9d  I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.  â\\x80\\x9cI can offer you no consolation, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9cyour disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cTo go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.â\\x80\\x9d  During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. â\\x80\\x9cPoor William!â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cdear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murdererâ\\x80\\x99s grasp! How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.â\\x80\\x9d  Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.  My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.  I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, â\\x80\\x9cthe palaces of nature,â\\x80\\x9d were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.  The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. â\\x80\\x9cDear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?â\\x80\\x9d  I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!  Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.  It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.  I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from SalÃªve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of CopÃªt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the MÃ´le, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.  While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, â\\x80\\x9cWilliam, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!â\\x80\\x9d As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dÃ¦mon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont SalÃªve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.  I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?  No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.  Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and I hastened to my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house. My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont SalÃªve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.  It was about five in the morning when I entered my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house. I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.  Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: â\\x80\\x9cWelcome, my dearest Victor,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cAh! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.â\\x80\\x94Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!â\\x80\\x9d  Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brotherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.  â\\x80\\x9cShe most of all,â\\x80\\x9d said Ernest, â\\x80\\x9crequires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been discoveredâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do not know what you mean,â\\x80\\x9d replied my brother, in accents of wonder, â\\x80\\x9cbut to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cJustine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNo one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.â\\x80\\x9d  He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.  This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, â\\x80\\x9cYou are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.â\\x80\\x9d  At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cGood God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWe do also, unfortunately,â\\x80\\x9d replied my father, â\\x80\\x9cfor indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.â\\x80\\x9d  This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?  We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect. She welcomed me with the greatest affection. â\\x80\\x9cYour arrival, my dear cousin,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cfills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cShe is innocent, my Elizabeth,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cand that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.â\\x80\\x9d She wept.  â\\x80\\x9cDearest niece,â\\x80\\x9d said my father, â\\x80\\x9cdry your tears. If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 8   We passed a few sad hours until eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, when the trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.  The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.  The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.  Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.  â\\x80\\x9cGod knows,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9chow entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.â\\x80\\x9d  She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at ChÃªne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no account.  â\\x80\\x9cI know,â\\x80\\x9d continued the unhappy victim, â\\x80\\x9chow heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?  â\\x80\\x9cI commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.â\\x80\\x9d  Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court.  â\\x80\\x9cI am,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cthe cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.â\\x80\\x9d  A murmur of approbation followed Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dÃ¦mon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.  I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.  I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt. â\\x80\\x9cThat evidence,â\\x80\\x9d he observed, â\\x80\\x9cwas hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.â\\x80\\x9d  This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.  â\\x80\\x9cMy cousin,â\\x80\\x9d replied I, â\\x80\\x9cit is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. But she has confessed.â\\x80\\x9d  This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justineâ\\x80\\x99s innocence. â\\x80\\x9cAlas!â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cHow shall I ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.â\\x80\\x9d  Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide. â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, â\\x80\\x9cI will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone.â\\x80\\x9d The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.  We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.  â\\x80\\x9cOh, Justine!â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cWhy did you rob me of my last consolation? I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?â\\x80\\x9d Her voice was suffocated with sobs.  â\\x80\\x9cRise, my poor girl,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cwhy do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.â\\x80\\x9d  She paused, weeping, and then continued, â\\x80\\x9cI thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die! You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.â\\x80\\x9d  Justine shook her head mournfully. â\\x80\\x9cI do not fear to die,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cthat pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven!â\\x80\\x9d  During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, â\\x80\\x9cDear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?â\\x80\\x9d  I could not answer. â\\x80\\x9cNo, Justine,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9che is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.â\\x80\\x9d  Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. â\\x80\\x9cI wish,â\\x80\\x9d cried she, â\\x80\\x9cthat I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.â\\x80\\x9d  Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, â\\x80\\x9cFarewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.â\\x80\\x9d  And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!  From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving youâ\\x80\\x94he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!  Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.     Chapter 9   Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.  This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolationâ\\x80\\x94deep, dark, deathlike solitude.  My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me. â\\x80\\x9cDo you think, Victor,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat I do not suffer also? No one could love a child more than I loved your brotherâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94tears came into his eyes as he spokeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cbut is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.â\\x80\\x9d  This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.  About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenlyâ\\x80\\x94if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shoreâ\\x80\\x94often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?  At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.  Our house was the house of mourning. My fatherâ\\x80\\x99s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen I reflect, my dear cousin,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9con the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each otherâ\\x80\\x99s blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.â\\x80\\x9d  I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, â\\x80\\x9cMy dearest friend, you must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessingâ\\x80\\x94what can disturb our peace?â\\x80\\x9d  And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.  Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.  Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.  I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotenceâ\\x80\\x94and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings.  I passed the bridge of PÃ©lissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_, and its tremendous _dÃ´me_ overlooked the valley.  A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence ceased to actâ\\x80\\x94I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myselfâ\\x80\\x94or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.  At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured. For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.     Chapter 10   I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the cloudsâ\\x80\\x94they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.  Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.  The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.    We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.      We rise; one wandâ\\x80\\x99ring thought pollutes the day.   We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,      Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;   It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,      The path of its departure still is free.   Manâ\\x80\\x99s yesterday may neâ\\x80\\x99er be like his morrow;      Nought may endure but mutability!   It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cWandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.â\\x80\\x9d  As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.  â\\x80\\x9cDevil,â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cdo you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI expected this reception,â\\x80\\x9d said the dÃ¦mon. â\\x80\\x9cAll men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAbhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed.â\\x80\\x9d  My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.  He easily eluded me and said,  â\\x80\\x9cBe calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBegone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWhy do you call to my remembrance,â\\x80\\x9d I rejoined, â\\x80\\x9ccircumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThus I relieve thee, my creator,â\\x80\\x9d he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; â\\x80\\x9cthus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.â\\x80\\x9d  As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.     Chapter 11   â\\x80\\x9cIt is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.  â\\x80\\x9cSoon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.  â\\x80\\x9cSeveral changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.  â\\x80\\x9cThe moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.  â\\x80\\x9cOne day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.  â\\x80\\x9cFood, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as PandÃ¦monium appeared to the dÃ¦mons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasantâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.  â\\x80\\x9cHere, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me.  â\\x80\\x9cHaving thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.  â\\x80\\x9cBeing thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.  â\\x80\\x9cOn examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.  â\\x80\\x9cSoon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.  â\\x80\\x9cThe old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.  â\\x80\\x9cNight quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old manâ\\x80\\x99s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.  â\\x80\\x9cThe family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 12   â\\x80\\x9cI lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.  â\\x80\\x9cThe cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.  â\\x80\\x9cThis day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.  â\\x80\\x9cThey were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one anotherâ\\x80\\x99s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.  â\\x80\\x9cA considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.  â\\x80\\x9cThis trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.  â\\x80\\x9cI discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.  â\\x80\\x9cI remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.  â\\x80\\x9cBy degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and _wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or _Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good, dearest, unhappy._  â\\x80\\x9cI spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.  â\\x80\\x9cI could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.  â\\x80\\x9cThis reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.  â\\x80\\x9cI had admired the perfect forms of my cottagersâ\\x80\\x94their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.  â\\x80\\x9cAs the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.  â\\x80\\x9cThe old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.  â\\x80\\x9cMy mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.  â\\x80\\x9cMy thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.  â\\x80\\x9cThese thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.  â\\x80\\x9cThe pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 13   â\\x80\\x9cI now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.  â\\x80\\x9cSpring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labourâ\\x80\\x94the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to himâ\\x80\\x94that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his sonâ\\x80\\x99s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.  â\\x80\\x9cFelix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old manâ\\x80\\x99s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.  â\\x80\\x9cI soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.  â\\x80\\x9cAs night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, â\\x80\\x98Good night sweet Safie.â\\x80\\x99 He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.  â\\x80\\x9cThe next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.  â\\x80\\x9cThe days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.  â\\x80\\x9cIn the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.  â\\x80\\x9cMy days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.  â\\x80\\x9cWhile I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.  â\\x80\\x9cThe book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volneyâ\\x80\\x99s _Ruins of Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romansâ\\x80\\x94of their subsequent degeneratingâ\\x80\\x94of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.  â\\x80\\x9cThese wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.  â\\x80\\x9cEvery conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.  â\\x80\\x9cThe words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?  â\\x80\\x9cI cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!  â\\x80\\x9cOf what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was deathâ\\x80\\x94a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!  â\\x80\\x9cOther lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.  â\\x80\\x9cBut where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.  â\\x80\\x9cI will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 14   â\\x80\\x9cSome time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.  â\\x80\\x9cThe name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.  â\\x80\\x9cThe father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.  â\\x80\\x9cFelix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.  â\\x80\\x9cThe Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness.  â\\x80\\x9cDuring the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.  â\\x80\\x9cI have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.  â\\x80\\x9cSafie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.  â\\x80\\x9cThe day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.  â\\x80\\x9cFelix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.  â\\x80\\x9cSafie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.  â\\x80\\x9cThe Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.  â\\x80\\x9cThe government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.  â\\x80\\x9cHe did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.  â\\x80\\x9cThey found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.  â\\x80\\x9cSuch were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.  â\\x80\\x9cA few days after, the Turk entered his daughterâ\\x80\\x99s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.  â\\x80\\x9cShe arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 15   â\\x80\\x9cSuch was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.  â\\x80\\x9cAs yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.  â\\x80\\x9cOne night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.  Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume of _Plutarchâ\\x80\\x99s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.  â\\x80\\x9cI can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.  â\\x80\\x9cAs I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none. â\\x80\\x98The path of my departure was free,â\\x80\\x99 and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.  â\\x80\\x9cThe volume of _Plutarchâ\\x80\\x99s Lives_ which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I learned from Werterâ\\x80\\x99s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.  â\\x80\\x9cBut _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.  â\\x80\\x9cAnother circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are. Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. â\\x80\\x98Hateful day when I received life!â\\x80\\x99 I exclaimed in agony. â\\x80\\x98Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThese were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every dayâ\\x80\\x99s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.  â\\x80\\x9cSeveral changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.  â\\x80\\x9cI endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adamâ\\x80\\x99s supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.  â\\x80\\x9cAutumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.  â\\x80\\x9cThe winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors.  â\\x80\\x9cOne day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.  â\\x80\\x9cMy heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage.  â\\x80\\x9cI knocked. â\\x80\\x98Who is there?â\\x80\\x99 said the old man. â\\x80\\x98Come in.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cI entered. â\\x80\\x98Pardon this intrusion,â\\x80\\x99 said I; â\\x80\\x98I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Enter,â\\x80\\x99 said De Lacey, â\\x80\\x98and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cI sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me.  â\\x80\\x98By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Are they Germans?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98They are kindâ\\x80\\x94they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Where do these friends reside?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Near this spot.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe old man paused and then continued, â\\x80\\x98If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98May I know the names and residence of those friends?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cI paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, â\\x80\\x98Now is the time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Great God!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed the old man. â\\x80\\x98Who are you?â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cAt that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 16   â\\x80\\x9cCursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.  â\\x80\\x9cBut this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.  â\\x80\\x9cThe sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.  â\\x80\\x9cThe pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party.  â\\x80\\x9cThese thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense.  â\\x80\\x9cPresently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Do you consider,â\\x80\\x99 said his companion to him, â\\x80\\x98that you will be obliged to pay three monthsâ\\x80\\x99 rent and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98It is utterly useless,â\\x80\\x99 replied Felix; â\\x80\\x98we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cFelix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.  â\\x80\\x9cI continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.  â\\x80\\x9cAs the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.  â\\x80\\x9cAs soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.  â\\x80\\x9cAnd now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth. You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed.  â\\x80\\x9cBut how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.  â\\x80\\x9cMy travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.  â\\x80\\x9cI generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.  â\\x80\\x9cI continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.  â\\x80\\x9cThis was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.  â\\x80\\x9cFor some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revengeâ\\x80\\x94a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.  â\\x80\\x9cAfter some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.  â\\x80\\x9cBut my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva.  â\\x80\\x9cIt was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.  â\\x80\\x9cAt this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.  â\\x80\\x9cUrged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, â\\x80\\x98Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cHe struggled violently. â\\x80\\x98Let me go,â\\x80\\x99 he cried; â\\x80\\x98monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndicâ\\x80\\x94he is M. Frankensteinâ\\x80\\x94he will punish you. You dare not keep me.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemyâ\\x80\\x94to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.  â\\x80\\x9cI gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cAs I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.  â\\x80\\x9cCan you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them.  â\\x80\\x9cWhile I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over her and whispered, â\\x80\\x98Awake, fairest, thy lover is nearâ\\x80\\x94he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!â\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x9cThe sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within meâ\\x80\\x94not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.  â\\x80\\x9cFor some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects. This being you must create.â\\x80\\x9d     Chapter 17   The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued,  â\\x80\\x9cYou must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.â\\x80\\x9d  The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.  â\\x80\\x9cI do refuse it,â\\x80\\x9d I replied; â\\x80\\x9cand no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou are in the wrong,â\\x80\\x9d replied the fiend; â\\x80\\x9cand instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.â\\x80\\x9d  A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceededâ\\x80\\x94  â\\x80\\x9cI intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creatureâ\\x80\\x99s sake I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!â\\x80\\x9d  I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling and continued,  â\\x80\\x9cIf you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou propose,â\\x80\\x9d replied I, â\\x80\\x9cto fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.â\\x80\\x9d  His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.  â\\x80\\x9cYou swear,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cto be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cHow is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.â\\x80\\x9d  I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I said,  â\\x80\\x9cI consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI swear,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9cby the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.â\\x80\\x9d  Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice.  His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cOh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.â\\x80\\x9d  These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.  Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensationsâ\\x80\\x94they weighed on me with a mountainâ\\x80\\x99s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed under a banâ\\x80\\x94as if I had no right to claim their sympathiesâ\\x80\\x94as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.     Chapter 18   Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.  It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me,  â\\x80\\x9cI am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.â\\x80\\x9d  I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continuedâ\\x80\\x94  â\\x80\\x9cI confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.â\\x80\\x9d  I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace.  I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever.  These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself.  The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?  To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My fatherâ\\x80\\x99s age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toilsâ\\x80\\x94one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her.  I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.  It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clervalâ\\x80\\x94and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a womanâ\\x80\\x99s sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell.  I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.  After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky. â\\x80\\x9cThis is what it is to live,â\\x80\\x9d he cried; â\\x80\\x9cnow I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful!â\\x80\\x9d In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.  We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene.  We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. â\\x80\\x9cI have seen,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cthe most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.â\\x80\\x9d  Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the â\\x80\\x9cvery poetry of nature.â\\x80\\x9d His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:â\\x80\\x94      â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94The sounding cataract     Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,     The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,     Their colours and their forms, were then to him     An appetite; a feeling, and a love,     That had no need of a remoter charm,     By thought supplied, or any interest     Unborrowâ\\x80\\x99d from the eye.            [Wordsworthâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cTintern Abbeyâ\\x80\\x9d.]  And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;â\\x80\\x94has this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.  Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my tale.  Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us.  Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwichâ\\x80\\x94places which I had heard of even in my country.  At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paulâ\\x80\\x99s towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.     Chapter 19   London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.  If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.  But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.  After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.  We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.  We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us.  From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.  I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to beâ\\x80\\x94a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.  We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.  We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.  From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. â\\x80\\x9cI could pass my life here,â\\x80\\x9d said he to me; â\\x80\\x9cand among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.â\\x80\\x9d  But he found that a travellerâ\\x80\\x99s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.  We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dÃ¦monâ\\x80\\x99s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.  I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s Seat, St. Bernardâ\\x80\\x99s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.  We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrewâ\\x80\\x99s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone. â\\x80\\x9cDo you,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cenjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.â\\x80\\x9d  Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. â\\x80\\x9cI had rather be with you,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cin your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.â\\x80\\x9d  Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion.  With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.  On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.  In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.  In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.  Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.  In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.     Chapter 20   I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.  Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dÃ¦mon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.  I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the dÃ¦mon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.  As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.  I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.  Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.  In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.  Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice,  â\\x80\\x9cYou have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBegone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cSlave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThe hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dÃ¦mon whose delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.â\\x80\\x9d  The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger. â\\x80\\x9cShall each man,â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cfind a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn. Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge remainsâ\\x80\\x94revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDevil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIt is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.â\\x80\\x9d  I started forward and exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cVillain! Before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.â\\x80\\x9d  I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.  All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I thought again of his wordsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c_I will be with you on your wedding-night._â\\x80\\x9d That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle.  The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last nightâ\\x80\\x99s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dÃ¦mon whom I had myself created.  I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.  The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.  Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.  Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dÃ¦mon. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.  Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.  I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave. â\\x80\\x9cFiend,â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cyour task is already fulfilled!â\\x80\\x9d I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clervalâ\\x80\\x94all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.  Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.  Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.  How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.  As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. â\\x80\\x9cMy good friends,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cwill you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYou will know that soon enough,â\\x80\\x9d replied a man with a hoarse voice. â\\x80\\x9cMaybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.â\\x80\\x9d  I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions. â\\x80\\x9cWhy do you answer me so roughly?â\\x80\\x9d I replied. â\\x80\\x9cSurely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do not know,â\\x80\\x9d said the man, â\\x80\\x9cwhat the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.â\\x80\\x9d  While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, â\\x80\\x9cCome, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwinâ\\x80\\x99s to give an account of yourself.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWho is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free country?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAy, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.â\\x80\\x9d  This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.  I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.     Chapter 21   I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.  About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.  The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.  The son confirmed his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed.  A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.  Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.  Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 from the place where I had deposited the corpse.  Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.  I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cHave my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactorâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d  The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.  A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.  Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?  But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.  This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.  â\\x80\\x9cAre you better now, sir?â\\x80\\x9d said she.  I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, â\\x80\\x9cI believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cFor that matter,â\\x80\\x9d replied the old woman, â\\x80\\x9cif you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, thatâ\\x80\\x99s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.â\\x80\\x9d  I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.  As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?  These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals.  One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French,  â\\x80\\x9cI fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.â\\x80\\x9d  As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say,  â\\x80\\x9cImmediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter. But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThis suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cYour family is perfectly well,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; â\\x80\\x9cand someone, a friend, is come to visit you.â\\x80\\x9d  I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony,  â\\x80\\x9cOh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, do not let him enter!â\\x80\\x9d  Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone,  â\\x80\\x9cI should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy father!â\\x80\\x9d cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure. â\\x80\\x9cIs my father indeed come? How kind, how very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?â\\x80\\x9d  My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.  Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,  â\\x80\\x9cAre you then safeâ\\x80\\x94and Elizabethâ\\x80\\x94and Ernest?â\\x80\\x9d  My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a place is this that you inhabit, my son!â\\x80\\x9d said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room. â\\x80\\x9cYou travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And poor Clervalâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d  The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.  â\\x80\\x9cAlas! Yes, my father,â\\x80\\x9d replied I; â\\x80\\x9csome destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry.â\\x80\\x9d  We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.  As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.  The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.  My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.  My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.  Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreckâ\\x80\\x94the shadow of a human being. My strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame.  Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores. It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.  Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiendâ\\x80\\x99s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.     Chapter 22   The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My fatherâ\\x80\\x99s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!  My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.  â\\x80\\x9cAlas! My father,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9chow little do you know me.  Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of thisâ\\x80\\x94I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henryâ\\x80\\x94they all died by my hands.â\\x80\\x9d  My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.  Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, â\\x80\\x9cMy dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI am not mad,â\\x80\\x9d I cried energetically; â\\x80\\x9cthe sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.â\\x80\\x9d  The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.  As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice.  A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Friend,  â\\x80\\x9cIt gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.  â\\x80\\x9cYet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet.  Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied. But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.  â\\x80\\x9cYou well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truthâ\\x80\\x94Do you not love another?  â\\x80\\x9cYou have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.  â\\x80\\x9cDo not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.  â\\x80\\x9cElizabeth Lavenza.    â\\x80\\x9cGeneva, May 18th, 17â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d    This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiendâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c_I will be with you on your wedding-night!_â\\x80\\x9d Such was my sentence, and on that night would the dÃ¦mon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.  Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angelâ\\x80\\x99s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s happiness, my adversaryâ\\x80\\x99s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour.  In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. â\\x80\\x9cI fear, my beloved girl,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9clittle happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.â\\x80\\x9d  In about a week after the arrival of Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s letter we returned to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.  The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.  Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.  Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth. I remained silent.  â\\x80\\x9cHave you, then, some other attachment?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cNone on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cMy dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.â\\x80\\x9d  Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words â\\x80\\x9c_I shall be with you on your wedding-night_,â\\x80\\x9d I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.  Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.  As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.  Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. Through my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood.  In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.  Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.  After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.  Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont SalÃªve, the pleasant banks of MontalÃ¨gre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.  I took the hand of Elizabeth. â\\x80\\x9cYou are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cBe happy, my dear Victor,â\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth; â\\x80\\x9cthere is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature appears!â\\x80\\x9d  Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.  The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.  The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever.     Chapter 23   It was eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.  The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.  I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished.  Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh! Peace, peace, my love,â\\x80\\x9d replied I; â\\x80\\x9cthis night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.â\\x80\\x9d  I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.  She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.  Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I turn I see the same figureâ\\x80\\x94her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas! Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.  When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the fiendâ\\x80\\x99s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.  While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.  The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.  I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost.  After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.  There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.  But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.  I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delightâ\\x80\\x94his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.  What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.  Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their causeâ\\x80\\x94the monster whom I had created, the miserable dÃ¦mon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.  Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.  The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. â\\x80\\x9cBe assured, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cno pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI thank you,â\\x80\\x9d replied I; â\\x80\\x9clisten, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.â\\x80\\x9d My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.  The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.  When I had concluded my narration, I said, â\\x80\\x9cThis is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.â\\x80\\x9d  This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, â\\x80\\x9cI would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cI do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.â\\x80\\x9d  As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated. â\\x80\\x9cYou are mistaken,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cI will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThat cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.â\\x80\\x9d  I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.  â\\x80\\x9cMan,â\\x80\\x9d I cried, â\\x80\\x9chow ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.â\\x80\\x9d  I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.     Chapter 24   My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.  My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.  And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.  When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.  The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cBy the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dÃ¦mon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.â\\x80\\x9d  I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.  I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, â\\x80\\x9cI am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.â\\x80\\x9d  I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.  I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.  Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.  I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dÃ¦mon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.  My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the dÃ¦mon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.  What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury. â\\x80\\x9cMy reign is not yet overâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94these words were legible in one of these inscriptionsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cyou live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.â\\x80\\x9d  Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!  As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.  The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription that he left was in these words: â\\x80\\x9cPrepare! Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.â\\x80\\x9d  My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversaryâ\\x80\\x99s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.  Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one dayâ\\x80\\x99s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.  On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair. He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.  I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.  I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.  By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart! Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the dÃ¦mon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.  But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hourâ\\x80\\x99s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two daysâ\\x80\\x99 journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.  But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death.  In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life. I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.  Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dÃ¦mon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not liveâ\\x80\\x94swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the steel aright.  Walton, _in continuation._   August 26th, 17â\\x80\\x94.   You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.  His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence! I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creatureâ\\x80\\x99s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.  â\\x80\\x9cAre you mad, my friend?â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cOr whither does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.â\\x80\\x9d  Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. â\\x80\\x9cSince you have preserved my narration,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.â\\x80\\x9d  Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.  Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen younger,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI believed myself destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.â\\x80\\x9d  Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.  â\\x80\\x9cI thank you, Walton,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cfor your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.â\\x80\\x9d  My beloved Sister,  September 2d.   I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.  And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!  My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair.  September 5th.   A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.  We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.  I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friendâ\\x80\\x94his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlesslyâ\\x80\\x94I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards.  This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said,  â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then, so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? â\\x80\\x9cAnd wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.â\\x80\\x9d  He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return.  They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life.  How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships.  September 7th.   The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience.  September 12th.   It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not despond.  September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult. â\\x80\\x9cThey shout,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cbecause they will soon return to England.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo you, then, really return?â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAlas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cDo so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength.â\\x80\\x9d Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.  It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.  His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, â\\x80\\x9cAlas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.  â\\x80\\x9cYet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion.  â\\x80\\x9cThat he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.â\\x80\\x9d  His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.  Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation.  I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine. Good night, my sister.  Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.  I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describeâ\\x80\\x94gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay.  He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.  â\\x80\\x9cThat is also my victim!â\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. â\\x80\\x9cIn his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me.â\\x80\\x9d  His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.  â\\x80\\x9cYour repentance,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cis now superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd do you dream?â\\x80\\x9d said the dÃ¦mon. â\\x80\\x9cDo you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse? He,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, pointing to the corpse, â\\x80\\x9che suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine.  â\\x80\\x9cAfter the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!â\\x80\\x9d  I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me. â\\x80\\x9cWretch!â\\x80\\x9d I said. â\\x80\\x9cIt is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cOh, it is not thusâ\\x80\\x94not thus,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted the being. â\\x80\\x9cYet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.  â\\x80\\x9cYou, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.  â\\x80\\x9cBut it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.  â\\x80\\x9cFear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any manâ\\x80\\x99s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?  â\\x80\\x9cFarewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.  â\\x80\\x9cBut soon,â\\x80\\x9d he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, â\\x80\\x9cI shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell.â\\x80\\x9d  He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.     *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FRANKENSTEIN ***  ***** This file should be named 84-0.txt or 84-0.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:     https://www.gutenberg.org/8/84/  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.  We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called \"paprika hendl,\" and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don\\'t know how I should be able to get on without it.  Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.  In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count all about them.)  I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was \"mamaliga,\" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call \"impletata.\" (_Mem._, get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?  All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.  It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.  Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, \"The Herr Englishman?\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"Jonathan Harker.\" She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with a letter:--       \"My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting      you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will      start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo      Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust      that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you      will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.  \"Your friend,  \"DRACULA.\"   _4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count, directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting.  Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way:  \"Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?\" She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, she asked again:  \"Do you know what day it is?\" I answered that it was the fourth of May. She shook her head as she said again:  \"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?\" On my saying that I did not understand, she went on:  \"It is the eve of St. George\\'s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?\" She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, \"For your mother\\'s sake,\" and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady\\'s fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the coach!         *       *       *       *       *  _5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called \"robber steak\"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cat\\'s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.  When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning \"word-bearer\"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were \"Ordog\"--Satan, \"pokol\"--hell, \"stregoica\"--witch, \"vrolok\" and \"vlkoslak\"--both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these superstitions)  When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat--\"gotza\" they call them--cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.  I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the \"Mittel Land\" ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.  Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us:--  \"Look! Isten szek!\"--\"God\\'s seat!\"--and he crossed himself reverently.  As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant\\'s cart--with its long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver\\'s haste, the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it. \"No, no,\" he said; \"you must not walk here; the dogs are too fierce\"; and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest--\"and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep.\" The only stop he would make was a moment\\'s pause to light his lamps.  When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I thought it was \"An hour less than the time.\" Then turning to me, he said in German worse than my own:--  \"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day.\" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a calÃ¨che, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--  \"You are early to-night, my friend.\" The man stammered in reply:--  \"The English Herr was in a hurry,\" to which the stranger replied:--  \"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.\" As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger\\'s \"Lenore\":--      \"Denn die Todten reiten schnell\"--     (\"For the dead travel fast.\")  The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. \"Give me the Herr\\'s luggage,\" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calÃ¨che. Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the calÃ¨che was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:--  \"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\" I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.  Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to jump from the calÃ¨che and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.  Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.  Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver\\'s motions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.  At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.  All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the calÃ¨che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.  When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calÃ¨che, and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.     CHAPTER II  JONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL--_continued_   _5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.  When the calÃ¨che stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings.  I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people? What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor\\'s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor\\'s clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of the morning.  Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back.  Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--  \"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!\" He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--  \"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring!\" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--  \"Count Dracula?\" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--  \"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in; the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.\" As he was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I protested but he insisted:--  \"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not available. Let me see to your comfort myself.\" He insisted on carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared.  The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the door:--  \"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.\"  The light and warmth and the Count\\'s courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty toilet, I went into the other room.  I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of his hand to the table, and said:--  \"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.\"  I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me. He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure.  \"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take your instructions in all matters.\"  The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had experienced.  By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host\\'s desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.  His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.  Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count\\'s eyes gleamed, and he said:--  \"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!\" Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added:--  \"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter.\" Then he rose and said:--  \"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon; so sleep well and dream well!\" With a courteous bow, he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....  I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me!         *       *       *       *       *  _7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which was written:--  \"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.\" I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one. There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value. The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court, but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves. Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o\\'clock when I had it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about the castle until I had asked the Count\\'s permission. There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.  In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the London Directory, the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" books, Whitaker\\'s Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the Law List.  Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good night\\'s rest. Then he went on:--  \"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that will interest you. These companions\"--and he laid his hand on some of the books--\"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books. To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\"  \"But, Count,\" I said, \"you know and speak English thoroughly!\" He bowed gravely.  \"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.\"  \"Indeed,\" I said, \"you speak excellently.\"  \"Not so,\" he answered. \"Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, \\'Ha, ha! a stranger!\\' I have been so long master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand.\"  Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might come into that room when I chose. He answered: \"Yes, certainly,\" and added:--  \"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.\" I said I was sure of this, and then he went on:--  \"We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of what strange things there may be.\"  This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to talk, if only for talking\\'s sake, I asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice. Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed. \"That treasure has been hidden,\" he went on, \"in the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil.\"  \"But how,\" said I, \"can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?\" The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--  \"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to find these places again?\"  \"There you are right,\" I said. \"I know no more than the dead where even to look for them.\" Then we drifted into other matters.  \"Come,\" he said at last, \"tell me of London and of the house which you have procured for me.\" With an apology for my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw\\'s Guide. When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--  \"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I fall into my country\\'s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!\"  We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here:--  \"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust.  \"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all periods back, I should say, to mediÃ¦val times, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.\"  When I had finished, he said:--  \"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young; and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may.\" Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine.  Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.  It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. \"Aha!\" he said; \"still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I am informed that your supper is ready.\" He took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate. After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host\\'s wishes in every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide. They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--  \"Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us,\" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.  I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.         *       *       *       *       *  _8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with, and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say at once how I stand--or seem to.  I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count\\'s voice saying to me, \"Good-morning.\" I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count\\'s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.  \"Take care,\" he said, \"take care how you cut yourself. It is more dangerous than you think in this country.\" Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on: \"And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief. It is a foul bauble of man\\'s vanity. Away with it!\" and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.  When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests.  But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit.  The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!     CHAPTER III  JONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL--_continued_   When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me. I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.  I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them. This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful, however, not to awake his suspicion.         *       *       *       *       *  _Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said \"we,\" and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of his race:--  \"We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?\" He held up his arms. \"Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, \\'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.\\' Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the \\'bloody sword,\\' or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of MohÃ¡cs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart\\'s blood, their brains, and their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.\"  It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the \"Arabian Nights,\" for everything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet\\'s father.)         *       *       *       *       *  _12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters I had been examining at Lincoln\\'s Inn. There was a certain method in the Count\\'s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.  First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him, so he said:--  \"I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?\" I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble.  \"But,\" said he, \"I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?\"  \"Of course,\" I replied; and \"such is often done by men of business, who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.\"  \"Good!\" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books available, he suddenly stood up and said:--  \"Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other?\" It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody.  \"Then write now, my young friend,\" he said, laying a heavy hand on my shoulder: \"write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.\"  \"Do you wish me to stay so long?\" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the thought.  \"I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not stinted. Is it not so?\"  What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins\\'s interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way:--  \"I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting home to them. Is it not so?\" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I could.  One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth, bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--  \"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.\" At the door he turned, and after a moment\\'s pause said:--  \"Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then\"--He finished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.  When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count\\'s own room would look out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.  What I saw was the Count\\'s head coming out from the window. I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, _face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.  What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....         *       *       *       *       *  _15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion. He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count\\'s room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere \"modernity\" cannot kill.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past. Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say:--      \"My tablets! quick, my tablets!     \\'Tis meet that I put it down,\" etc.,  for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose. The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.  The Count\\'s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!  When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count\\'s warning came into my mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.  I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina\\'s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth. They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on. One said:--  \"Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to begin.\" The other added:--  \"He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.\" I lay quiet, looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation. The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.  I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one\\'s flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there. I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating heart.  But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant\\'s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--  \"How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware how you meddle with him, or you\\'ll have to deal with me.\" The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--  \"You yourself never loved; you never love!\" On this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said in a soft whisper:--  \"Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work to be done.\"  \"Are we to have nothing to-night?\" said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.  Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.     CHAPTER IV  JONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL--_continued_   I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.         *       *       *       *       *  _18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for I _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside. I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.         *       *       *       *       *  _19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and then said:--  \"The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29.\"  I know now the span of my life. God help me!         *       *       *       *       *  _28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law. They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion, save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany tongue.  I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could their spoken language....         *       *       *       *       *  I have written the letters. Mina\\'s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation, but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge....         *       *       *       *       *  I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....         *       *       *       *       *  The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters:--  \"The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they come, I shall, of course, take care. See!\"--he must have looked at it--\"one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other\"--here he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--\"the other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.\" And he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he went on:--  \"The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?\" He held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.  When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been sleeping, he said:--  \"So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours to me; but you will sleep, I pray.\" I passed to my room and went to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.         *       *       *       *       *  _31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a surprise, again a shock!  Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda, relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.  The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new scheme of villainy....         *       *       *       *       *  _17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses\\' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard. With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a shock: my door was fastened on the outside.  Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the \"hetman\" of the Szgany came out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away. The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each to his horse\\'s head. Shortly afterwards, I heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.         *       *       *       *       *  _24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on. The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some ruthless villainy.  I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw something coming out of the Count\\'s window. I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest, and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me.  It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal\\'s right and consolation.  I thought I would watch for the Count\\'s return, and for a long time sat doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the aÃ«rial gambolling.  Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly.  When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the Count\\'s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.  As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--  \"Monster, give me my child!\"  She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.  Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.  There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.  I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and she was better dead.  What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear?         *       *       *       *       *  _25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth.  Let me not think of it. Action!  It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room! But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.  Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man\\'s death is not a calf\\'s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!         *       *       *       *       *  _Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty well the direction and distance of the Count\\'s window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery. The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.  At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended, minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a discovery.  There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours. By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there. I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Count\\'s room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think....         *       *       *       *       *  _29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man\\'s hand would have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there till I fell asleep.  I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said:--  \"To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula.\" I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity. Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--  \"Why may I not go to-night?\"  \"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.\"  \"But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.\" He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness. He said:--  \"And your baggage?\"  \"I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.\"  The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real:--  \"You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is that which rules our _boyars_: \\'Welcome the coming; speed the parting guest.\\' Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that you so suddenly desire it. Come!\" With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he stopped.  \"Hark!\"  Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bÃ¢ton of the conductor. After a pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open.  To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.  As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count\\'s body stood in the gap. Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as a last chance I cried out:--  \"Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!\" and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.  In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of.  When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--  \"Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!\" There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.  I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear!         *       *       *       *       *  _30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready.  At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe. With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts.  But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the Count.  Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count\\'s room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count\\'s room. It was empty, but that was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.  The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell.  I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count\\'s room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened. With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely.  As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.  The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.  Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels, the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the distance.  I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman, and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!  I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.  And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet!  At least God\\'s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man. Good-bye, all! Mina!     CHAPTER V  _Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra._   \"_9 May._  \"My dearest Lucy,--  \"Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying. I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan\\'s studies, and I have been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I shall keep a diary in the same way. I don\\'t mean one of those two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange countries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them together. There is the ten o\\'clock bell ringing. Good-bye.  \"Your loving  \"MINA.  \"Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for a long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome, curly-haired man???\"   _Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.  \"_17, Chatham Street_,  \"_Wednesday_.  \"My dearest Mina,--  \"I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I wrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your _second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr. Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some time ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read one\\'s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do you ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day. There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other since we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn\\'t you guess? I love him. I am blushing as I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel. I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter, and I don\\'t want to stop, for I _do_ so want to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.  \"LUCY.  \"P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.  \"L.\"  _Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.  \"_24 May_.  \"My dearest Mina,--  \"Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.  \"My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are. Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three. Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn\\'t it awful! I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don\\'t know what to do with myself. And three proposals! But, for goodness\\' sake, don\\'t tell any of the girls, or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don\\'t you think so, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don\\'t generally do when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman\\'s heart was free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can\\'t help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn\\'t at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.  \"_Evening._  \"Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I don\\'t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P. Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl alone. No, he doesn\\'t, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn\\'t always speak slang--that is to say, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well educated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--  \"\\'Miss Lucy, I know I ain\\'t good enough to regulate the fixin\\'s of your little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won\\'t you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together, driving in double harness?\\'  \"Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn\\'t seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I wasn\\'t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn\\'t help feeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid flirt--though I couldn\\'t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest, because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--  \"\\'Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is I\\'ll never trouble you a hair\\'s breadth again, but will be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend.\\'  \"My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true gentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very badly. Why can\\'t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into Mr. Morris\\'s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--  \"\\'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he even loves me.\\' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I think I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--  \"\\'That\\'s my brave girl. It\\'s better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don\\'t cry, my dear. If it\\'s for me, I\\'m a hard nut to crack; and I take it standing up. If that other fellow doesn\\'t know his happiness, well, he\\'d better look for it soon, or he\\'ll have to deal with me. Little girl, your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that\\'s rarer than a lover; it\\'s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I\\'m going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won\\'t you give me one kiss? It\\'ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow, my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn\\'t spoken yet.\\' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and noble, too, to a rival--wasn\\'t it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down into my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--  \"\\'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you\\'ve kissed me, and if these things don\\'t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet honesty to me, and good-bye.\\' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only I don\\'t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I don\\'t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.  \"Ever your loving  \"LUCY.  \"P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn\\'t tell you of number Three, need I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was kissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don\\'t know what I have done to deserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a lover, such a husband, and such a friend.  \"Good-bye.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  (Kept in phonograph)  _25 May._--Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so diary instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am determined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.  I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madness--a thing which I avoid with the patients as I would the mouth of hell.  (_Mem._, under what circumstances would I _not_ avoid the pit of hell?) _Omnia RomÃ¦ venalia sunt._ Hell has its price! _verb. sap._ If there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards _accurately_, so I had better commence to do so, therefore--  R. M. Renfield, Ã¦tat 59.--Sanguine temperament; great physical strength; morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of accidents can balance it.   _Letter, Quincey P.

I bear messages which will make both your ears tingle.  \"ART.\"     CHAPTER VI  MINA MURRAY\\'S JOURNAL   _24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of \"Marmion,\" where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk.  The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.  It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he is coming this way....  He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady at the abbey he said very brusquely:--  \"I wouldn\\'t fash masel\\' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out. Mind, I don\\'t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn\\'t in my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an\\' the like, but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and Leeds that be always eatin\\' cured herrin\\'s an\\' drinkin\\' tea an\\' lookin\\' out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel\\' who\\'d be bothered tellin\\' lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of fool-talk.\" I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--  \"I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn\\'t like to be kept waitin\\' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of \\'em; an\\', miss, I lack belly-timber sairly by the clock.\"  He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how many--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did not go. They will be home by this.         *       *       *       *       *  _1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can\\'t out-argue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down. She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends, and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it and put it down:--  \"It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that\\'s what it be, an\\' nowt else. These bans an\\' wafts an\\' boh-ghosts an\\' barguests an\\' bogles an\\' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an\\' dizzy women a-belderin\\'. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an\\' all grims an\\' signs an\\' warnin\\'s, be all invented by parsons an\\' illsome beuk-bodies an\\' railway touters to skeer an\\' scunner hafflin\\'s, an\\' to get folks to do somethin\\' that they don\\'t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think o\\' them. Why, it\\'s them that, not content with printin\\' lies on paper an\\' preachin\\' them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin\\' them on the tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them steans, holdin\\' up their heads as well as they can out of their pride, is acant--simply tumblin\\' down with the weight o\\' the lies wrote on them, \\'Here lies the body\\' or \\'Sacred to the memory\\' wrote on all of them, an\\' yet in nigh half of them there bean\\'t no bodies at all; an\\' the memories of them bean\\'t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less sacred. Lies all of them, nothin\\' but lies of one kind or another! My gog, but it\\'ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they come tumblin\\' up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an\\' tryin\\' to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them trimmlin\\' and ditherin\\', with their hands that dozzened an\\' slippy from lyin\\' in the sea that they can\\'t even keep their grup o\\' them.\"  I could see from the old fellow\\'s self-satisfied air and the way in which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was \"showing off,\" so I put in a word to keep him going:--  \"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can\\'t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?\"  \"Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin\\' where they make out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now look you here; you come here a stranger, an\\' you see this kirk-garth.\" I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church. He went on: \"And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be happed here, snod an\\' snog?\" I assented again. \"Then that be just where the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as old Dun\\'s \\'bacca-box on Friday night.\" He nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed. \"And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!\" I went over and read:--  \"Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, Ã¦t. 30.\" When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--  \"Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast of Andres! an\\' you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above\"--he pointed northwards--\"or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in the _Lively_ off Greenland in \\'20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in \\'50. Do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they\\'d be jommlin\\' an\\' jostlin\\' one another that way that it \\'ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days, when we\\'d be at one another from daylight to dark, an\\' tryin\\' to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.\" This was evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his cronies joined in with gusto.  \"But,\" I said, \"surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think that will be really necessary?\"  \"Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!\"  \"To please their relatives, I suppose.\"  \"To please their relatives, you suppose!\" This he said with intense scorn. \"How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?\" He pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. \"Read the lies on that thruff-stean,\" he said. The letters were upside down to me from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over and read:--  \"Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son. \\'He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.\\' Really, Mr. Swales, I don\\'t see anything very funny in that!\" She spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.  \"Ye don\\'t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that\\'s because ye don\\'t gawm the sorrowin\\' mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was acrewk\\'d--a regular lamiter he was--an\\' he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightn\\'t get an insurance she put on his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin\\' the crows with. \\'Twarn\\'t for crows then, for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That\\'s the way he fell off the rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I\\'ve often heard him say masel\\' that he hoped he\\'d go to hell, for his mother was so pious that she\\'d be sure to go to heaven, an\\' he didn\\'t want to addle where she was. Now isn\\'t that stean at any rate\"--he hammered it with his stick as he spoke--\"a pack of lies? and won\\'t it make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin\\' up the grees with the tombstean balanced on his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!\"  I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she said, rising up:--  \"Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide.\"  \"That won\\'t harm ye, my pretty; an\\' it may make poor Geordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin\\' on his lap. That won\\'t hurt ye. Why, I\\'ve sat here off an\\' on for nigh twenty years past, an\\' it hasn\\'t done me no harm. Don\\'t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn\\' lie there either! It\\'ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field. There\\'s the clock, an\\' I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!\" And off he hobbled.  Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I haven\\'t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.         *       *       *       *       *  _The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan. The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly; they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of a donkey\\'s hoofs up the paved road below. The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street. Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he were here.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _5 June._--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed; selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own, but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: \"May I have three days? I shall clear them away.\" Of course, I said that would do. I must watch him.         *       *       *       *       *  _18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room.         *       *       *       *       *  _1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the totals added in batches again, as though he were \"focussing\" some account, as the auditors put it.         *       *       *       *       *  _8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh, unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food.         *       *       *       *       *  _19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very, very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing:--  \"A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with, and teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!\" I was not unprepared for this request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--  \"Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?\" I shook my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know more.         *       *       *       *       *  _10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it. I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.         *       *       *       *       *  _20 July._--Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar, which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away. There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day.         *       *       *       *       *  _11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. \"My belief is, doctor,\" he said, \"that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took and ate them raw!\"         *       *       *       *       *  _11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoÃ¶phagous (life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had I even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which Burdon-Sanderson\\'s physiology or Ferrier\\'s brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?  How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?  To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope, and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on hopeless and work. Work! work!  If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a good, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness.   _Mina Murray\\'s Journal._  _26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it is like whispering to one\\'s self and listening at the same time. And there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan; I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy, although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy\\'s father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he arrives.         *       *       *       *       *  _27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him, though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy\\'s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely rose-pink. She has lost that anÃ¦mic look which she had. I pray it will all last.         *       *       *       *       *  _3 August._--Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room searching for the key.  _6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock; grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a \"brool\" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom. Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem \"men like trees walking.\" The fishing-boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that he wants to talk....  I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--  \"I want to say something to you, miss.\" I could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--  \"I\\'m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked things I\\'ve been sayin\\' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past; but I didn\\'t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I\\'m gone. We aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don\\'t altogether like to think of it, and we don\\'t want to feel scart of it; an\\' that\\'s why I\\'ve took to makin\\' light of it, so that I\\'d cheer up my own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain\\'t afraid of dyin\\', not a bit; only I don\\'t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect; and I\\'m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin\\' his scythe. Ye see, I can\\'t get out o\\' the habit of caffin\\' about it all at once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don\\'t ye dooal an\\' greet, my deary!\"--for he saw that I was crying--\"if he should come this very night I\\'d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a waitin\\' for somethin\\' else than what we\\'re doin\\'; and death be all that we can rightly depend on. But I\\'m content, for it\\'s comin\\' to me, my deary, and comin\\' quick. It may be comin\\' while we be lookin\\' and wonderin\\'. Maybe it\\'s in that wind out over the sea that\\'s bringin\\' with it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!\" he cried suddenly. \"There\\'s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It\\'s in the air; I feel it comin\\'. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call comes!\" He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes\\' silence, he got up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.  I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time kept looking at a strange ship.  \"I can\\'t make her out,\" he said; \"she\\'s a Russian, by the look of her; but she\\'s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn\\'t know her mind a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can\\'t decide whether to run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is steered mighty strangely, for she doesn\\'t mind the hand on the wheel; changes about with every puff of wind. We\\'ll hear more of her before this time to-morrow.\"     CHAPTER VII  CUTTING FROM \"THE DAILYGRAPH,\" 8 AUGUST   (_Pasted in Mina Murray\\'s Journal._)  From a Correspondent.  _Whitby_.  One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood\\'s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of \"tripping\" both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of \"mares\\'-tails\" high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked \"No. 2: light breeze.\" The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the \"Prelude to the Great Storm\" will grace the R. A. and R. I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his \"cobble\" or his \"mule,\" as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed. The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually \"hug\" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,      \"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.\"  Shortly before ten o\\'clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the great harmony of nature\\'s silence. A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.  Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster. White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm.  Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea. Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.  Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, \"she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell.\" Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.  There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the \"top-hammer\" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones--\"thruff-steans\" or \"through-stones,\" as they call them in the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.  It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd. When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.  It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to await inquest.  Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating; crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm.  _Whitby_  _9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the _Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould. This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations. As the matter is to be a \"nine days\\' wonder,\" they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found; it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite to its master\\'s yard. It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been permitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my statement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short.                           LOG OF THE \"DEMETER.\"   _Varna to Whitby._  _Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land._         *       *       *       *       *  On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth. At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates, cook, and myself (captain).         *       *       *       *       *  On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.         *       *       *       *       *  On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but quick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.         *       *       *       *       *  On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something. Seemed scared, but would not speak out.         *       *       *       *       *  On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only told him there was _something_, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet.         *       *       *       *       *  On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last night; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more downcast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but would not say more than there was _something_ aboard. Mate getting very impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.         *       *       *       *       *  On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way, and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously, but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed. He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from stem to stern.         *       *       *       *       *  Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but said nothing.         *       *       *       *       *  _22 July_.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with sails--no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread. Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.         *       *       *       *       *  _24 July_.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short, and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last night another man lost--disappeared. Like the first, he came off his watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do some violence.         *       *       *       *       *  _28 July_.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom, and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours\\' sleep. Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is steadier.         *       *       *       *       *  _29 July_.--Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search, but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.         *       *       *       *       *  _30 July_.--Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine, all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and two hands left to work ship.         *       *       *       *       *  _1 August_.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere. Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower, as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are Russian, he Roumanian.         *       *       *       *       *  _2 August, midnight_.--Woke up from few minutes\\' sleep by hearing a cry, seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God seems to have deserted us.         *       *       *       *       *  _3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: \"_It_ is here; I know it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the air.\" And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space. Then he went on: \"But It is here, and I\\'ll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I\\'ll unscrew them one by one and see. You work the helm.\" And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it\\'s no use my trying to stop him. He can\\'t hurt those big boxes: they are invoiced as \"clay,\" and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I can\\'t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails and lie by, and signal for help....         *       *       *       *       *  It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear. \"Save me! save me!\" he cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said: \"You had better come too, captain, before it is too late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me from Him, and it is all that is left!\" Before I could say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these horrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?         *       *       *       *       *  _4 August._--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in the dimness of the night I saw It--Him! God forgive me, but the mate was right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with them I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not, ... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty....         *       *       *       *       *  Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce; and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave.  No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so will end this one more \"mystery of the sea.\"   _Mina Murray\\'s Journal._  _8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the chimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life.  Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But, oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!         *       *       *       *       *  _10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortÃ¨ge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way. The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset. She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing: she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog. The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cat\\'s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all afford material for her dreams.  I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood\\'s Bay and back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.     CHAPTER VIII  MINA MURRAY\\'S JOURNAL   _Same day, 11 o\\'clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital \"severe tea\" at Robin Hood\\'s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have shocked the \"New Woman\" with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could. The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don\\'t take supper, no matter how they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now. Some of the \"New Women\" writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won\\'t condescend in future to accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make of it, too! There\\'s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.         *       *       *       *       *  _11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write. I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary.... Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark, so I could not see Lucy\\'s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside. Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. \"Thank God,\" I said to myself, \"she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.\" I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don\\'t know which--of seeing Lucy in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary\\'s Church and all around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy\\'s condition. The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, \"Lucy! Lucy!\" and something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.  When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was. Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not. However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.  Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or \"wynds,\" as they call them in Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her mother\\'s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay, infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....         *       *       *       *       *  _Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.         *       *       *       *       *  _Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any trouble to-night.         *       *       *       *       *  _12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can\\'t alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable.         *       *       *       *       *  _13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great, silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully. She did not stir again all night.         *       *       *       *       *  _14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--  \"His red eyes again! They are just the same.\" It was such an odd expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary\\'s Church behind our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I called Lucy\\'s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance up at our window, and saw Lucy\\'s head leaning out. I thought that perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it from cold.  I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened.  She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it is.         *       *       *       *       *  _15 August._--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and slept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast. Arthur\\'s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucy\\'s sleep-walking.         *       *       *       *       *  _17 August._--No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness. No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her mother\\'s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy\\'s fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed. They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with red centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.   _Letter, Samuel F.

Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were in any way anÃ¦mic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--  \"My poor little feet didn\\'t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn\\'t want to wake up Geordie.\" As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don\\'t wonder that he does. Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself:--  \"I didn\\'t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be here in this spot--I don\\'t know why, for I was afraid of something--I don\\'t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air. I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do it before I felt you.\"  Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy evening together.         *       *       *       *       *  _19 August._--Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary, and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister\\'s letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is _in_ my heart. My journey is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for it, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet.   _Letter, Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, Buda-Pesth, to Miss Wilhelmina Murray._  \"_12 August._  \"Dear Madam,--  \"I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks, suffering from a violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love, and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins, Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his delay, and that all of his work is completed. He will require some few weeks\\' rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall not be wanting for help.  \"Believe me,  \"Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,  \"SISTER AGATHA.  \"P. S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something more. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his wife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock--so says our doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way thither that the train reached.  \"Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for safety\\'s sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many, many, happy years for you both.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About eight o\\'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he would say was:--       \"I don\\'t want to talk to you: you don\\'t count now; the Master is at      hand.\"  The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The combination is a dreadful one. At nine o\\'clock I visited him myself. His attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh, if men only knew!  For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--  \"Bother them all! I don\\'t care a pin about them.\"  \"What?\" I said. \"You don\\'t mean to tell me you don\\'t care about spiders?\" (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--  \"The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride; but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled.\"  He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time I remained with him.  I am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been. If I don\\'t sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to let it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be, to-night shall be sleepless....         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me. He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off. The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn\\'t get through the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house.  I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield\\'s figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in. I heard him say:--  \"I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?\"  He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger. He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn\\'t get free from the strait-waistcoat that keeps him restrained, and he\\'s chained to the wall in the padded room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.  Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--  \"I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!\"  So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.     CHAPTER IX   _Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._  \"_Buda-Pesth, 24 August._  \"My dearest Lucy,--  \"I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse, tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself, and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again, and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about, added: \\'I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can treat of.\\' I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of _my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps. He is waking!...  \"When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things. I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment. Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--  \"\\'Wilhelmina\\'--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--\\'you know, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.\\' For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete. \\'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.\\' He fell back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her reply....         *       *       *       *       *  \"She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon after as Jonathan awakes....         *       *       *       *       *  \"Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his \\'I will\\' firmly and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words \\'my husband\\'--left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife\\'s_ hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the year.  \"Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn pledge between us....  \"Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be _always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan is waking--I must attend to my husband!  \"Your ever-loving  \"MINA HARKER.\"   _Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker._  \"_Whitby, 30 August._  \"My dearest Mina,--  \"Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own home with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has quite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together; and I love him more than ever. He _tells_ me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn\\'t love me more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me. So no more just at present from your loving  \"LUCY.  \"P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear. \"P. P. S.--We are to be married on 28 September.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _20 August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion. For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself: \"Now I can wait; now I can wait.\" The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might almost say, \"cringing\"--softness. I was satisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them:--  \"They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!\"  It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will only say: \"I don\\'t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now, and I can wait; I can wait.\"  After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.         *       *       *       *       *  ... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went. Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they are required....         *       *       *       *       *  _23 August._--\"The unexpected always happens.\" How well Disraeli knew life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room, when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul\\'s body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark! The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow. Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught the patient\\'s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said:--  \"You needn\\'t tie me; I shall go quietly!\" Without trouble we came back to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall not forget this night....   _Lucy Westenra\\'s Diary_  _Hillingham, 24 August._--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things down. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me, for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me, and I hadn\\'t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder if I could sleep in mother\\'s room to-night. I shall make an excuse and try.         *       *       *       *       *  _25 August._--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my proposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don\\'t seem ever to get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I know he will be miserable to see me so.   _Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward._  \"_Albemarle Hotel, 31 August._  \"My dear Jack,--  \"I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to disturb the poor lady\\'s mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is spoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl\\'s mind. I am almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. I told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at first--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be a painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at Hillingham to-morrow, two o\\'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I can after you have seen her. Do not fail!  \"ARTHUR.\"   _Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward._  \"_1 September._  \"Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fully by to-night\\'s post to Ring. Wire me if necessary.\"   _Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood._  \"_2 September._  \"My dear old fellow,--  \"With regard to Miss Westenra\\'s health I hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have done and propose doing.  \"I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present, and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is. We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--  \"\\'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.\\' I reminded her that a doctor\\'s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that matter in a word. \\'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for myself, but all for him!\\' So I am quite free.  \"I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see the usual anÃ¦mic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.  \"Yours always,  \"JOHN SEWARD.\"   _Letter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr. Seward._  \"_2 September._  \"My good Friend,--  \"When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By good fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have trusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But it is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come. Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be near to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here that night. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer if it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.   \"VAN HELSING.\"   _Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._  \"_3 September._  \"My dear Art,--  \"Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and found that, by Lucy\\'s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned, but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter, he said: \\'You must tell him all you think. Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.\\' I asked what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for _The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make it. In any case I am to have a letter.  \"Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy\\'s pretense of animation merge into reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--  \"\\'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly pale. To them I say: \"Pouf!\"\\' And he snapped his fingers at me and went on: \\'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can he\\'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--\\'know anything of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.\\' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but said: \\'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anÃ¦mic. I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say. And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if there be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well is a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.\\'  \"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone. And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from me.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _4 September._--ZoÃ¶phagous patient still keeps up our interest in him. He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly. I cannot quite understand it.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o\\'clock I looked in on him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--  \"All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do it for myself!\" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said: \"Doctor, won\\'t you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar? I think it would be good for me.\"  \"And the flies?\" I said.  \"Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like it.\" And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.         *       *       *       *       *  _Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised me, so I asked him: \"Are you not going to keep flies any more?\"  \"No,\" said he; \"I am sick of all that rubbish!\" He certainly is a wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others? We shall see.   _Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._  \"_4 September._--Patient still better to-day.\"   _Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._  \"_5 September._--Patient greatly improved. Good appetite; sleeps naturally; good spirits; colour coming back.\"   _Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._  \"_6 September._--Terrible change for the worse. Come at once; do not lose an hour. I hold over telegram to Holmwood till have seen you.\"     CHAPTER X   _Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._  \"_6 September._  \"My dear Art,--  \"My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit. There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy\\'s weak condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for news. In haste  Yours ever,  \"JOHN SEWARD.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at Liverpool Street was:--  \"Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?\"  \"No,\" I said. \"I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.\"  \"Right, my friend,\" he said, \"quite right! Better he not know as yet; perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God\\'s madmen, too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.\" He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself the same way. \"I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall unfold to you.\"  \"Why not now?\" I asked. \"It may do some good; we may arrive at some decision.\" He stopped and looked at me, and said:--  \"My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you: \\'Look! he\\'s good corn; he will make good crop when the time comes.\\'\" I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: \"The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all, there\\'s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.\" He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very gravely:--  \"You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker. Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!\"  When I described Lucy\\'s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, \"the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade,\" as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of.  I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy\\'s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or hear. Van Helsing\\'s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door. \"My God!\" he said; \"this is dreadful. There is no time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart\\'s action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?\"  \"I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.\"  \"Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.\"  I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper:--  \"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming.\" When first the Professor\\'s eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand:--  \"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.\" For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. \"You are to help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your best help.\"  \"What can I do?\" asked Arthur hoarsely. \"Tell me, and I shall do it. My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her.\" The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--  \"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!\"  \"What shall I do?\" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. \"Come!\" he said. \"You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than me, better than my friend John.\" Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--  \"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is the more young and strong than me\"--here Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence--\"but, now you are here, you are more good than us, old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!\" Arthur turned to him and said:--  \"If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would understand----\"  He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.  \"Good boy!\" said Van Helsing. \"In the not-so-far-off you will be happy that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!\"  We all went up to Lucy\\'s room. Arthur by direction remained outside. Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--  \"Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.\" She had made the effort with success.  It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his coat. Then he added: \"You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring over the table. Friend John, help to me!\" So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.  Van Helsing turning to me, said:  \"He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it.\"  Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy\\'s cheeks, and through Arthur\\'s growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy\\'s system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her. But the Professor\\'s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: \"Do not stir an instant. It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.\" When all was over I could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--  \"The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently.\" And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient\\'s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing\\'s ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying: \"Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir, that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you have done. Good-bye.\"  When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently. The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper:--  \"What do you make of that mark on her throat?\"  \"What do you make of it?\"  \"I have not examined it yet,\" I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.  \"Well?\" said Van Helsing.  \"Well,\" said I, \"I can make nothing of it.\" The Professor stood up. \"I must go back to Amsterdam to-night,\" he said. \"There are books and things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you must not let your sight pass from her.\"  \"Shall I have a nurse?\" I asked.  \"We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as possible. And then we may begin.\"  \"May begin?\" I said. \"What on earth do you mean?\"  \"We shall see!\" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up:--  \"Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter!\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary--continued._  _8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter\\'s renewed strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--  \"You do not want to go to sleep?\"  \"No; I am afraid.\"  \"Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.\"  \"Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!\"  \"A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?\"  \"I don\\'t know; oh, I don\\'t know. And that is what is so terrible. All this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.\"  \"But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and I can promise that nothing will happen.\"  \"Ah, I can trust you!\" I seized the opportunity, and said: \"I promise you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.\"  \"You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will sleep!\" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.  All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.  In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my zoÃ¶phagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning.         *       *       *       *       *  _9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said:--  \"No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you.\" I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning. \"Now,\" she said, \"you must stay here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once.\" I could not but acquiesce, for I was \"dog-tired,\" and could not have sat up had I tried. So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything, I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.   _Lucy Westenra\\'s Diary._  _9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak, that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me. And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God! Good-night, Arthur.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor\\'s hand on my head, and started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate.  \"And how is our patient?\"  \"Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,\" I answered.  \"Come, let us see,\" he said. And together we went into the room.  The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.  As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professor\\'s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of horror, \"Gott in Himmel!\" needed no enforcement from his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.  There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly. \"Quick!\" he said. \"Bring the brandy.\" I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter. He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising suspense said:--  \"It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John.\" As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment\\'s delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one\\'s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing held up a warning finger. \"Do not stir,\" he said, \"but I fear that with growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia.\" He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.  The Professor watched me critically. \"That will do,\" he said. \"Already?\" I remonstrated. \"You took a great deal more from Art.\" To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--  \"He is her lover, her _fiancÃ©_. You have work, much work, to do for her and for others; and the present will suffice.\"  When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered:--  \"Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!\"  When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--  \"You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.\"  I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges--tiny though they were.  Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.  Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to me gratefully:--  \"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you do!\" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.  Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: \"Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think even the most not-probable. Good-night.\"  In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing\\'s wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the \"foreign gentleman.\" I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy\\'s account, that their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman\\'s kindness. I got back here in time for a late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting for sleep. It is coming.         *       *       *       *       *  _11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of white flowers.  \"These are for you, Miss Lucy,\" he said.  \"For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!\"  \"Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.\" Here Lucy made a wry face. \"Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.\"  Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and half-disgust:--  \"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why, these flowers are only common garlic.\"  To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--  \"No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do; and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own.\" Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently: \"Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience; and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year. I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.\"  We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor\\'s actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said:--  \"Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.\"  \"Perhaps I am!\" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.  We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck. The last words he said to her were:--  \"Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do not to-night open the window or the door.\"  \"I promise,\" said Lucy, \"and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?\"  As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--  \"To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my \\'spell\\' which I have work. Ho! ho!\"  He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.     CHAPTER XI  _Lucy Westenra\\'s Diary._   _12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr. Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with \"virgin crants and maiden strewments.\" I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful! There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night, everybody.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual, up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.  Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o\\'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature\\'s annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early riser. She greeted us warmly and said:--  \"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her.\" The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He rubbed his hands together, and said:--  \"Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,\" to which she answered:--  \"You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy\\'s state this morning is due in part to me.\"  \"How you do mean, ma\\'am?\" asked the Professor.  \"Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into her room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be pleased with her, I am sure.\"  She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As she had spoken, I watched the Professor\\'s face, and saw it turn ashen grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be; he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.  Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. \"God! God! God!\" he said. \"What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!\" Suddenly he jumped to his feet. \"Come,\" he said, \"come, we must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same.\" He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to Lucy\\'s room.  Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed. This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.  \"As I expected,\" he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand. \"No!\" he said. \"To-day you must operate. I shall provide. You are weakened already.\" As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeve.  Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.  Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must not remove anything from Lucy\\'s room without consulting him; that the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come.  After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.  What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.   _Lucy Westenra\\'s Diary._  _17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left alone. Thank God for mother\\'s sake, and dear Arthur\\'s, and for all our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the window-panes.   _\"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" 18 September._                             THE ESCAPED WOLF.           PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.           _Interview with the Keeper in the ZoÃ¶logical Gardens._  After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using the words \"Pall Mall Gazette\" as a sort of talisman, I managed to find the keeper of the section of the ZoÃ¶logical Gardens in which the wolf department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called \"business\" until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--  \"Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You\\'ll excoose me refoosin\\' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk them questions.\"  \"How do you mean, ask them questions?\" I queried, wishful to get him into a talkative humour.  \"\\'Ittin\\' of them over the \\'ead with a pole is one way; scratchin\\' of their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals. I don\\'t so much mind the fust--the \\'ittin\\' with a pole afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they\\'ve \\'ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear-scratchin\\'. Mind you,\" he added philosophically, \"there\\'s a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here\\'s you a-comin\\' and arskin\\' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that only for your bloomin\\' \\'arf-quid I\\'d \\'a\\' seen you blowed fust \\'fore I\\'d answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I\\'d like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence did I tell yer to go to \\'ell?\"  \"You did.\"  \"An\\' when you said you\\'d report me for usin\\' of obscene language that was \\'ittin\\' me over the \\'ead; but the \\'arf-quid made that all right. I weren\\'t a-goin\\' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my \\'owl as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor\\' love yer \\'art, now that the old \\'ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an\\' rinsed me out with her bloomin\\' old teapot, and I\\'ve lit hup, you may scratch my ears for all you\\'re worth, and won\\'t git even a growl out of me. Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin\\' at, that \\'ere escaped wolf.\"  \"Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it happened; and when I know the facts I\\'ll get you to say what you consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will end.\"  \"All right, guv\\'nor. This \\'ere is about the \\'ole story. That \\'ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from Norway to Jamrach\\'s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I\\'m more surprised at \\'im for wantin\\' to get out nor any other animile in the place. But, there, you can\\'t trust wolves no more nor women.\"  \"Don\\'t you mind him, sir!\" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. \"\\'E\\'s got mindin\\' the animiles so long that blest if he ain\\'t like a old wolf \\'isself! But there ain\\'t no \\'arm in \\'im.\"  \"Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin\\' yesterday when I first hear my disturbance. I was makin\\' up a litter in the monkey-house for a young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin\\' and \\'owlin\\' I kem away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin\\' like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn\\'t much people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a \\'ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin\\' through it. He had a \\'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him, for it seemed as if it was \\'im as they was hirritated at. He \\'ad white kid gloves on \\'is \\'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says: \\'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.\\'  \"\\'Maybe it\\'s you,\\' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give \\'isself. He didn\\'t git angry, as I \\'oped he would, but he smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. \\'Oh no, they wouldn\\'t like me,\\' \\'e says.  \"\\'Ow yes, they would,\\' says I, a-imitatin\\' of him. \\'They always likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you \\'as a bagful.\\'  \"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin\\' they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn\\'t put in his hand and stroke the old wolf\\'s ears too!  \"\\'Tyke care,\\' says I. \\'Bersicker is quick.\\'  \"\\'Never mind,\\' he says. \\'I\\'m used to \\'em!\\'  \"\\'Are you in the business yourself?\\' I says, tyking off my \\'at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.  \"\\'No\\' says he, \\'not exactly in the business, but I \\'ave made pets of several.\\' And with that he lifts his \\'at as perlite as a lord, and walks away. Old Bersicker kep\\' a-lookin\\' arter \\'im till \\'e was out of sight, and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn\\'t come hout the \\'ole hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves here all began a-\\'owling. There warn\\'t nothing for them to \\'owl at. There warn\\'t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin\\' a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the \\'owling stopped. Just before twelve o\\'clock I just took a look round afore turnin\\' in, an\\', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker\\'s cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And that\\'s all I know for certing.\"  \"Did any one else see anything?\"  \"One of our gard\\'ners was a-comin\\' \\'ome about that time from a \\'armony, when he sees a big grey dog comin\\' out through the garding \\'edges. At least, so he says, but I don\\'t give much for it myself, for if he did \\'e never said a word about it to his missis when \\'e got \\'ome, and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all night-a-huntin\\' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein\\' anything. My own belief was that the \\'armony \\'ad got into his \\'ead.\"  \"Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf?\"  \"Well, sir,\" he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, \"I think I can; but I don\\'t know as \\'ow you\\'d be satisfied with the theory.\"  \"Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from experience, can\\'t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?\"  \"Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that \\'ere wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.\"  From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I could see that it had done service before, and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn\\'t cope in badinage with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart, so I said:--  \"Now, Mr. Bilder, we\\'ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off, and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you\\'ve told me what you think will happen.\"  \"Right y\\'are, sir,\" he said briskly. \"Ye\\'ll excoose me, I know, for a-chaffin\\' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much as telling me to go on.\"  \"Well, I never!\" said the old lady.  \"My opinion is this: that \\'ere wolf is a-\\'idin\\' of, somewheres. The gard\\'ner wot didn\\'t remember said he was a-gallopin\\' northward faster than a horse could go; but I don\\'t believe him, for, yer see, sir, wolves don\\'t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein\\' built that way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin\\' somethin\\' that\\'s more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But, Lor\\' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in \\'im. This one ain\\'t been used to fightin\\' or even to providin\\' for hisself, and more like he\\'s somewhere round the Park a-\\'idin\\' an\\' a-shiverin\\' of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin\\' where he is to get his breakfast from; or maybe he\\'s got down some area and is in a coal-cellar. My eye, won\\'t some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can\\'t get food he\\'s bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher\\'s shop in time. If he doesn\\'t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin\\' orf with a soldier, leavin\\' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I shouldn\\'t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That\\'s all.\"  I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up against the window, and Mr. Bilder\\'s face doubled its natural length with surprise.  \"God bless me!\" he said. \"If there ain\\'t old Bersicker come back by \\'isself!\"  He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.  After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all picture-wolves--Red Riding Hood\\'s quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence in masquerade.  The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--  \"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble; didn\\'t I say it all along? Here\\'s his head all cut and full of broken glass. \\'E\\'s been a-gettin\\' over some bloomin\\' wall or other. It\\'s a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles. This \\'ere\\'s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.\"  He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the fatted calf, and went off to report.  I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the Superintendent\\'s study is almost unknown. Without an instant\\'s pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and, as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely. Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again: \"The blood is the life! The blood is the life!\"  I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy\\'s illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and weary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without it.   _Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._  (Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by twenty-two hours.)  \"_17 September._--Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as placed; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van Helsing\\'s telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is possible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy\\'s phonograph.   _Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra._  _17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the doing.  I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.  I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out: \"Is there anybody there?\" There was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again. Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog\\'s, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in; seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--  \"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all right.\"  I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out: \"What is that?\" I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother\\'s poor body, which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to beat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.  The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother\\'s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn\\'t like to remove them, and, besides, I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining-room to look for them.  My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious, and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother\\'s doctor uses for her--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window.  The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!     CHAPTER XII  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY   _18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early. Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour--for it was now ten o\\'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses; and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.  I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse\\'s feet. They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue. When he saw me, he gasped out:--  \"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you not get my telegram?\"  I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here, and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly:--  \"Then I fear we are too late. God\\'s will be done!\" With his usual recuperative energy, he went on: \"Come. If there be no way open to get in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.\"  We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants\\' rooms, which were close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said: \"We can attend to them later.\" Then we ascended to Lucy\\'s room. For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room.  How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother\\'s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled. Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy\\'s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--  \"It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!\"  I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands. He said to me:--  \"I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids. Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything more.\"  I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.  I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--  \"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.\" He went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.  Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect. Lucy\\'s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing\\'s face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--  \"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!\"  We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.  Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me out of the room.  \"We must consult as to what is to be done,\" he said as we descended the stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light enough for our purposes. Van Helsing\\'s sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--  \"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl\\'s life won\\'t be worth an hour\\'s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her?\"  \"What\\'s the matter with me, anyhow?\"  The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: \"Quincey Morris!\" and rushed towards him with outstretched hands.  \"What brought you here?\" I cried as our hands met.  \"I guess Art is the cause.\"  He handed me a telegram:--  \"Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious. Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is. Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.\"  \"I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell me what to do.\"  Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in the eyes as he said:--  \"A brave man\\'s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble. You\\'re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against us for all he\\'s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.\"  Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved. He handed me the paper saying only: \"It dropped from Lucy\\'s breast when we carried her to the bath.\"  When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause asked him: \"In God\\'s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?\" I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying:--  \"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what is it that you came to me to say?\" This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself again.  \"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker.\"  \"Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the more for it! Now go.\"  In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--  \"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to ourselves?\" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.  When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature. So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said to me:--  \"Jack Seward, I don\\'t want to shove myself in anywhere where I\\'ve no right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her; but, although that\\'s all past and gone, I can\\'t help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that\\'s wrong with her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have _another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted. Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that so?\"  \"That\\'s so,\" I said, and he went on:--  \"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did to-day. Is not that so?\"  \"That\\'s so.\"  \"And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn\\'t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?\" As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase: \"That\\'s so.\"  \"And how long has this been going on?\"  \"About ten days.\"  \"Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn\\'t hold it.\" Then, coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: \"What took it out?\"  I shook my head. \"That,\" I said, \"is the crux. Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits\\' end. I can\\'t even hazard a guess. There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.\" Quincey held out his hand. \"Count me in,\" he said. \"You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I\\'ll do it.\"  When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy\\'s first movement was to feel in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that meant--that she had realised to the full her mother\\'s death; so we tried what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing.         *       *       *       *       *  _19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.  When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy\\'s strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him. Quincey went off to meet him at the station.  When he arrived it was nearly six o\\'clock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened. Arthur\\'s presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.  It was now nearly one o\\'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering this on Lucy\\'s phonograph. Until six o\\'clock they are to try to rest. I fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.   _Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._  (Unopened by her.)  \"_17 September._  \"My dearest Lucy,--  \"It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After dinner Mr. Hawkins said:--  \"\\'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in my will I have left you everything.\\' I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.  \"So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients.  \"How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it, dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his \\'respectful duty,\\' but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb, I send you simply his \\'love\\' instead. Good-bye, my dearest Lucy, and all blessings on you.  \"Yours,  \"MINA HARKER.\"   _Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I., etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._  \"_20 September._  \"My dear Sir,--  \"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier\\'s cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of Renfield\\'s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to \"shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar,\" whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: \\'Lor\\' bless yer, sir, I wouldn\\'t mind what was said to me in a bloomin\\' madhouse. I pity ye and the guv\\'nor for havin\\' to live in the house with a wild beast like that.\\' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he began to shout: \\'I\\'ll frustrate them! They shan\\'t rob me! they shan\\'t murder me by inches! I\\'ll fight for my Lord and Master!\\' and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set it all right; and he is going on well.  \"The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so \\'bloomin\\' good a bloke\\' as your correspondent. I took their names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as follows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding\\'s Rents, King George\\'s Road, Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley\\'s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and Shipment Company, Orange Master\\'s Yard, Soho.  \"I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall wire you at once if there is anything of importance.  \"Believe me, dear Sir,  \"Yours faithfully,  \"PATRICK HENNESSEY.\"   _Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra_.  (Unopened by her.)  \"_18 September._  \"My dearest Lucy,--  \"Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly. Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old man\\'s death is a real blow to me. Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_ helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which enabled him by our dear, good friend\\'s aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,  \"Your loving  \"MINA HARKER.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy\\'s mother and Arthur\\'s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.  I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. \"Come, my child,\" he said; \"come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep.\" Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy\\'s face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy\\'s neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her, and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.  Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed. She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.  At six o\\'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy\\'s face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper: \"Draw up the blind; I want light!\" Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy\\'s, examined her carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, \"Mein Gott!\" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.  The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.  For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--  \"She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.\"  I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. \"Come,\" I said, \"my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for her.\"  When we came into Lucy\\'s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy\\'s hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly:--  \"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!\" He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. \"No,\" he whispered, \"not yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.\"  So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child\\'s.  And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips:--  \"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!\" Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost across the room.  \"Not for your life!\" he said; \"not for your living soul and hers!\" And he stood between them like a lion at bay.  Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.  I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.  Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing\\'s great brown one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. \"My true friend,\" she said, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, \"My true friend, and his! Oh, guard him, and give me peace!\"  \"I swear it!\" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him: \"Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and only once.\"  Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.  Lucy\\'s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthur\\'s arm, and drew him away.  And then Lucy\\'s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased.  \"It is all over,\" said Van Helsing. \"She is dead!\"  I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.  I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body. Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be.      \"We thought her dying whilst she slept,         And sleeping when she died.\"  I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--  \"Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!\"  He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--  \"Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!\"  When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--  \"We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.\"     CHAPTER XIII  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--_continued_.   The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity. Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from the death-chamber:--  \"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It\\'s quite a privilege to attend on her. It\\'s not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment!\"  I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his father\\'s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy\\'s papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--  \"I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such as this.\"  As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been in Lucy\\'s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.  \"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucy\\'s old room all night, and I myself search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers.\"  I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra\\'s solicitor and had written to him. All the poor lady\\'s papers were in order; explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, saying:--  \"Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to you.\"  \"Have you got what you looked for?\" I asked, to which he replied:--  \"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some.\"  When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--  \"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!\"  Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small _chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy\\'s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of \"decay\\'s effacing fingers,\" had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.  The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: \"Remain till I return,\" and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we came away.  I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to speak:--  \"To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem knives.\"  \"Must we make an autopsy?\" I asked.  \"Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father\\'s funeral to-morrow, and he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace all, so that none know, save we alone.\"  \"But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous.\"  For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite tenderness:--  \"Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!  \"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is not perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel, oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!\" He paused a moment and went on solemnly: \"Friend John, there are strange and terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to a good end. Will you not have faith in me?\"  I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away, and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....         *       *       *       *       *  I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and said:--  \"You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.\"  \"Why not?\" I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me.  \"Because,\" he said sternly, \"it is too late--or too early. See!\" Here he held up the little golden crucifix. \"This was stolen in the night.\"  \"How, stolen,\" I asked in wonder, \"since you have it now?\"  \"Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.\"  He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle to grapple with.  The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucy\\'s father\\'s which now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had told us so much he went on:--  \"Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment. Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.\"  He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.  He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o\\'clock, so a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancÃ©e_ quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved.  Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily:--  \"You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don\\'t know how to thank you for all you have done for her. I can\\'t think yet....\"  Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast, crying:--  \"Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.\"  I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man\\'s heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said softly to him:--  \"Come and look at her.\"  Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face. God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--  \"Jack, is she really dead?\"  I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.  I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker\\'s men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur\\'s question, and he replied:--  \"I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!\"  We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but when we had lit our cigars he said--  \"Lord----\"; but Arthur interrupted him:--  \"No, no, not that, for God\\'s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir: I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so recent.\"  The Professor answered very sweetly:--  \"I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you \\'Mr.,\\' and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as Arthur.\"  Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man\\'s warmly.  \"Call me what you will,\" he said. \"I hope I may always have the title of a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear.\" He paused a moment, and went on: \"I know that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember\"--the Professor nodded--\"you must forgive me.\"  He answered with a grave kindness:--  \"I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect.\"  \"And, indeed, indeed, sir,\" said Arthur warmly, \"I shall in all ways trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are Jack\\'s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.\"  The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said:--  \"May I ask you something now?\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?\"  \"No, poor dear; I never thought of it.\"  \"And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy\\'s papers and letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which, be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back to you. It\\'s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for Lucy\\'s sake?\"  Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--  \"Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes.\"  The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--  \"And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our duty, and all will be well!\"  I slept on a sofa in Arthur\\'s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.  It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow....  The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....  We came back to town quietly, taking a \\'bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly. Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can\\'t go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn\\'t know anybody who saw us--and we didn\\'t care if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano\\'s, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath: \"My God!\" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.  He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal\\'s. Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that I knew as much about it as he did: \"Do you see who it is?\"  \"No, dear,\" I said; \"I don\\'t know him; who is it?\" His answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--  \"It is the man himself!\"  The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--  \"I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!\" He was distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place. After a few minutes\\' staring at nothing, Jonathan\\'s eyes closed, and he went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--  \"Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude. Come, and we\\'ll have a cup of tea somewhere.\" He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of. I don\\'t like this lapsing into forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he may be:--  \"You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.\"  Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our troubles.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy\\'s death as any of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy\\'s veins; I could see Van Helsing\\'s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried, till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious. He said:--  \"Ah, you don\\'t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad, though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say, \\'May I come in?\\' is not the true laughter. No! he is a king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no time of suitability. He say, \\'I am here.\\' Behold, in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say \\'Thud! thud!\\' to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear, \\'Here I am! here I am!\\' till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and, like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with our labour, what it may be.\"  I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different tone:--  \"Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going \\'Toll! toll! toll!\\' so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?\"  \"Well, for the life of me, Professor,\" I said, \"I can\\'t see anything to laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.\"  \"Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride?\"  \"Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.\"  \"Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church\\'s law, though no wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist.\"  \"I don\\'t see where the joke comes in there either!\" I said; and I did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid his hand on my arm, and said:--  \"Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust. If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh; if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all.\"  I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.  \"Because I know!\"  And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.  So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin another. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my life-work, I say sadly and without hope,                          \"FINIS.\"   _\"The Westminster Gazette,\" 25 September._                            A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.   The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as \"The Kensington Horror,\" or \"The Stabbing Woman,\" or \"The Woman in Black.\" During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a \"bloofer lady.\" It has always been late in the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a \"bloofer lady\" had asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the \"bloofer lady\" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the \"bloofer lady\" should be the popular rÃ´le at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naÃ¯vely says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine themselves--to be.  There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog which may be about.                  _\"The Westminster Gazette,\" 25 September._                              _Extra Special._                           THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR.                           ANOTHER CHILD INJURED.                           _The \"Bloofer Lady.\"_  We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the Shooter\\'s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common story to tell of being lured away by the \"bloofer lady.\"     CHAPTER XIV  MINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL   _23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself, and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal, and lock myself up in my room and read it....   _24 September_.--I hadn\\'t the heart to write last night; that terrible record of Jonathan\\'s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered, whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our wedding-day he said: \"Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.\" There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.   _Letter, Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._  \"_24 September._  (_Confidence_)  \"Dear Madam,--  \"I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra\\'s death. By the kindness of Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I find some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It is for others\\' good that I ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift much and terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. May it be that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward and of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it private for the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you at once if you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore your pardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be, enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.  \"VAN HELSING.\"   _Telegram, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._  \"_25 September._--Come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catch it. Can see you any time you call.  \"WILHELMINA HARKER.\"  MINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL.  _25 September._--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that it will throw some light upon Jonathan\\'s sad experience; and as he attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.  I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will occur to upset him. It is two o\\'clock, and the doctor will be here soon now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan\\'s journal unless he asks me. I am so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan\\'s journal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even a consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur\\'s friend and Dr. Seward\\'s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan; and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan\\'s friend on \"The Exeter News\" told him that memory was everything in such work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.  It was half-past two o\\'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _Ã\\xa0 deux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and announced \"Dr. Van Helsing.\"  I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man\\'s moods. He said to me:--  \"Mrs. Harker, is it not?\" I bowed assent.  \"That was Miss Mina Murray?\" Again I assented.  \"It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.\"  \"Sir,\" I said, \"you could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.\" And I held out my hand. He took it and said tenderly:--  \"Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good, but I had yet to learn----\" He finished his speech with a courtly bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began:--  \"I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.\"  \"I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.\"  \"Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always so with young ladies.\"  \"No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you if you like.\"  \"Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.\" I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful bow, and said:--  \"May I read it?\"  \"If you wish,\" I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.  \"Oh, you so clever woman!\" he said. \"I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things. And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me? Alas! I know not the shorthand.\" By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him.  \"Forgive me,\" I said: \"I could not help it; but I had been thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.\"  He took it and his eyes glistened. \"You are so good,\" he said. \"And may I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.\"  \"By all means,\" I said, \"read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat.\" He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.  \"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, \"how can I say what I owe to you? This paper is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so clever woman. Madam\"--he said this very solemnly--\"if ever Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know. It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights; you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and your husband will be blessed in you.\"  \"But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me.\"  \"Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels\\' eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your husband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty?\" I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I said:--  \"He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins\\'s death.\" He interrupted:--  \"Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.\" I went on:--  \"I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock.\"  \"A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of a shock was it?\"  \"He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something which led to his brain fever.\" And here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--  \"My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing years--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him that I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious. Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan\\'s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat now; afterwards you shall tell me all.\"  After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--  \"And now tell me all about him.\" When it came to speaking to this great learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said:--  \"Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I have even half believed some very strange things.\" He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said:--  \"Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little of any one\\'s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane.\"  \"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long, but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and Jonathan\\'s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell me what you think.\"  \"I promise,\" he said as I gave him the papers; \"I shall in the morning, so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.\"  \"Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which will leave you at Paddington before eight.\" He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in case he is in a hurry.  So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here thinking--thinking I don\\'t know what.         *       *       *       *       *  _Letter (by hand), Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._  \"_25 September, 6 o\\'clock._  \"Dear Madam Mina,--  \"I have read your husband\\'s so wonderful diary. You may sleep without doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! I will pledge my life on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no dread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men, that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room--ay, and going a second time--is not one to be injured in permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this I swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to ask him of other things. I am blessed that to-day I come to see you, for I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzle--dazzle more than ever, and I must think.  \"Yours the most faithful,  \"ABRAHAM VAN HELSING.\"   _Letter, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._  \"_25 September, 6:30 p. m._  \"My dear Dr. Van Helsing,--  \"A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight off my mind. And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really in London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come to breakfast at eight o\\'clock, if this be not too early for you? You can get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring you to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that, if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.  \"Believe me,  \"Your faithful and grateful friend,  \"MINA HARKER.\"   _Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._  _26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing\\'s visit, and of her having given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me. She showed me in the doctor\\'s letter that all I wrote down was true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....  He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--  \"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.\" It was so funny to hear my wife called \"Madam Mina\" by this kindly, strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--  \"I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already.\"  \"And how?\"  \"By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted myself. Doctor, you don\\'t know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don\\'t; you couldn\\'t with eyebrows like yours.\" He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--  \"So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.\" I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded and stood silent.  \"She is one of God\\'s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our lives.\"  We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite choky.  \"And now,\" he said, \"may I ask you for some more help? I have a great task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here. Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.\"  \"Look here, sir,\" I said, \"does what you have to do concern the Count?\"  \"It does,\" he said solemnly.  \"Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers. You can take them with you and read them in the train.\"  After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he said:--  \"Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina too.\"  \"We shall both come when you will,\" I said.  I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them, \"The Westminster Gazette\"--I knew it by the colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently, groaning to himself: \"Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!\" I do not think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand, calling out: \"Love to Madam Mina; I shall write so soon as ever I can.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week since I said \"Finis,\" and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o\\'clock, and thrust last night\\'s \"Westminster Gazette\" into my hand.  \"What do you think of that?\" he asked as he stood back and folded his arms.  I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An idea struck me, and I looked up. \"Well?\" he said.  \"It is like poor Lucy\\'s.\"  \"And what do you make of it?\"  \"Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured her has injured them.\" I did not quite understand his answer:--  \"That is true indirectly, but not directly.\"  \"How do you mean, Professor?\" I asked. I was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one\\'s spirits--but when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.  \"Tell me!\" I said. \"I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.\"  \"Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by events, but by me?\"  \"Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.\"  \"And how the blood lost or waste?\" I shook my head. He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on:--  \"You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold; but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men\\'s eyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in hypnotism----\"  \"Yes,\" I said. \"Charcot has proved that pretty well.\" He smiled as he went on: \"Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great Charcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and \\'Old Parr\\' one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men\\'s blood in her poor veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we could have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew, till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?\"  \"Good God, Professor!\" I said, starting up. \"Do you mean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century?\" He waved his hand for silence, and went on:--  \"Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint? Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and women who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the fact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?\" Here I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind his list of nature\\'s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said:--  \"Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where I am going.\"  \"That is good image,\" he said. \"Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is this: I want you to believe.\"  \"To believe what?\"  \"To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once of an American who so defined faith: \\'that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.\\' For one, I follow that man. He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe.\"  \"Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read your lesson aright?\"  \"Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children\\'s throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?\"  \"I suppose so.\" He stood up and said solemnly:--  \"Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse, far, far worse.\"  \"In God\\'s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?\" I cried.  He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--  \"They were made by Miss Lucy!\"     CHAPTER XV  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--_continued_.   For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to him:--  \"Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?\" He raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. \"Would I were!\" he said. \"Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful death? Ah no!\"  \"Forgive me,\" said I. He went on:--  \"My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the \\'no\\' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove it. Dare you come with me?\"  This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron excepted from the category, jealousy.      \"And prove the very truth he most abhorred.\"  He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--  \"The logic is simple, no madman\\'s logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief; at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then----\"  \"And then?\" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. \"And then we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to Arthur.\" My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing....  We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucy\\'s throat. They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London. \"Out of so many harmless ones,\" he said, \"there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from the ZoÃ¶logical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this \\'bloofer lady\\' scare came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the \\'bloofer lady.\\'\"  \"I hope,\" said Van Helsing, \"that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days?\"  \"Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not healed.\"  Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said:--  \"There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.\"  We dined at \"Jack Straw\\'s Castle\" along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o\\'clock we started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was not the only thing which could pass away.  Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy\\'s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.  \"What are you going to do?\" I asked.  \"To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.\" Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: \"You shall see,\" and again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.  I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.  It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task. \"Are you satisfied now, friend John?\" he asked.  I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him:--  \"I am satisfied that Lucy\\'s body is not in that coffin; but that only proves one thing.\"  \"And what is that, friend John?\"  \"That it is not there.\"  \"That is good logic,\" he said, \"so far as it goes. But how do you--how can you--account for it not being there?\"  \"Perhaps a body-snatcher,\" I suggested. \"Some of the undertaker\\'s people may have stolen it.\" I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. \"Ah well!\" he said, \"we must have more proof. Come with me.\"  He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and locked it. He handed me the key, saying: \"Will you keep it? You had better be assured.\" I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. \"A key is nothing,\" I said; \"there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind.\" He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.  It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.  Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the Professor\\'s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--  \"Are you satisfied now?\"  \"No,\" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.  \"Do you not see the child?\"  \"Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?\" I asked.  \"We shall see,\" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.  When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child\\'s throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.  \"Was I right?\" I asked triumphantly.  \"We were just in time,\" said the Professor thankfully.  We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child. So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman\\'s heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a cab near the \"Spaniards,\" and drove to town.  I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours\\' sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall go with him on another expedition.         *       *       *       *       *  _27 September._--It was two o\\'clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy\\'s coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.  There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.  \"Is this a juggle?\" I said to him.  \"Are you convinced now?\" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.  \"See,\" he went on, \"see, they are even sharper than before. With this and this\"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it--\"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend John?\" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--  \"She may have been placed here since last night.\"  \"Indeed? That is so, and by whom?\"  \"I do not know. Some one has done it.\"  \"And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not look so.\" I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--  \"Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home\"--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was \"home\"--\"their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.\" This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing\\'s theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously:--  \"Ah, you believe now?\"  I answered: \"Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to accept. How will you do this bloody work?\"  \"I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a stake through her body.\" It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective?  I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and said:--  \"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy\\'s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child\\'s at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all, an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.\"  So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.   _Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to John Seward, M. D._  (Not delivered.)  \"_27 September._  \"Friend John,--  \"I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager. Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead, and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter. He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy\\'s life, and we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be that he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.  \"Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this great Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so that the world may rest from him.  \"If it be so, farewell.  \"VAN HELSING.\"    _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night\\'s sleep will do for one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing\\'s monstrous ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_ rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some light on the mystery.         *       *       *       *       *  _29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o\\'clock, Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing\\'s room; he told us all that he wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too, \"for,\" he said, \"there is a grave duty to be done there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?\" This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.  \"I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that I\\'m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.\"  \"Me too,\" said Quincey Morris laconically.  \"Oh,\" said the Professor, \"then you are nearer the beginning, both of you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin.\"  It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said with intense gravity:--  \"I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.\"  \"That\\'s frank anyhow,\" broke in Quincey. \"I\\'ll answer for the Professor. I don\\'t quite see his drift, but I swear he\\'s honest; and that\\'s good enough for me.\"  \"I thank you, sir,\" said Van Helsing proudly. \"I have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear to me.\" He held out a hand, which Quincey took.  Then Arthur spoke out:--  \"Dr. Van Helsing, I don\\'t quite like to \\'buy a pig in a poke,\\' as they say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise. If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at.\"  \"I accept your limitation,\" said Van Helsing, \"and all I ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations.\"  \"Agreed!\" said Arthur; \"that is only fair. And now that the _pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?\"  \"I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at Kingstead.\"  Arthur\\'s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--  \"Where poor Lucy is buried?\" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: \"And when there?\"  \"To enter the tomb!\" Arthur stood up.  \"Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest.\" He sat down again, but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was silence until he asked again:--  \"And when in the tomb?\"  \"To open the coffin.\"  \"This is too much!\" he said, angrily rising again. \"I am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration of the grave--of one who----\" He fairly choked with indignation. The Professor looked pityingly at him.  \"If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,\" he said, \"God knows I would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!\"  Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--  \"Take care, sir, take care!\"  \"Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?\" said Van Helsing. \"And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go on?\"  \"That\\'s fair enough,\" broke in Morris.  After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--  \"Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to her. But if she be not dead----\"  Arthur jumped to his feet.  \"Good God!\" he cried. \"What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has she been buried alive?\" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften.  \"I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.\"  \"Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what is it?\"  \"There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?\"  \"Heavens and earth, no!\" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. \"Not for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr. Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or am I mad to listen to them? Don\\'t dare to think more of such a desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do it!\"  Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and said, gravely and sternly:--  \"My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship\\'s wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will.\" His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity:--  \"But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.\" He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man\\'s hand and said in a broken voice:--  \"Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I shall go with you and wait.\"     CHAPTER XVI  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--_continued_   It was just a quarter before twelve o\\'clock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--  \"You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin?\"  \"It was.\" The Professor turned to the rest saying:--  \"You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.\" He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled.  The coffin was empty!  For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by Quincey Morris:--  \"Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn\\'t ask such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn\\'t so dishonour you as to imply a doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour. Is this your doing?\"  \"I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be. So\"--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--\"now to the outside.\" He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him.  Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man\\'s life; how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing\\'s conclusions. Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious. He answered:--  \"I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.\"  \"And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?\" asked Quincey. \"Great Scott! Is this a game?\"  \"It is.\"  \"What is that which you are using?\" This time the question was by Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--  \"The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.\" It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor\\'s, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.  There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the Professor a keen \"S-s-s-s!\" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave. We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor\\'s warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy\\'s face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.  We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing\\'s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.  When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy\\'s eyes in form and colour; but Lucy\\'s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands.  She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said:--  \"Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!\"  There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.  When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsing\\'s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa\\'s snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could kill--we saw it at that moment.  And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--  \"Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?\"  Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he answered:--  \"Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like this ever any more;\" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.  When this was done, he lifted the child and said:  \"Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find him, as on the other night; and then to home.\" Coming close to Arthur, he said:--  \"My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.\"  Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep.         *       *       *       *       *  _29 September, night._--A little before twelve o\\'clock we three--Arthur, Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of fair weight.  When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy\\'s coffin we all looked--Arthur trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy\\'s shape without her soul. I could see even Arthur\\'s face grow hard as he looked. Presently he said to Van Helsing:--  \"Is this really Lucy\\'s body, or only a demon in her shape?\"  \"It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her as she was, and is.\"  She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucy\\'s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor\\'s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.  When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--  \"Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror. The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free. To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not: \\'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?\\' Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?\"  We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow:--  \"My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!\" Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said:--  \"Brave lad! A moment\\'s courage, and it is done. This stake must be driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the time.\"  \"Go on,\" said Arthur hoarsely. \"Tell me what I am to do.\"  \"Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall follow--strike in God\\'s name, that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.\"  Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.  The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault.  And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The terrible task was over.  The hammer fell from Arthur\\'s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad, strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it.  There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.  Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur\\'s shoulder, and said to him:--  \"And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?\"  The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man\\'s hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--  \"Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again, and me peace.\" He put his hands on the Professor\\'s shoulder, and laying his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--  \"And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is the devil\\'s Un-Dead. She is God\\'s true dead, whose soul is with Him!\"  Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid, and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked the door he gave the key to Arthur.  Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.  Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--  \"Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do we not promise to go on to the bitter end?\"  Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the Professor as we moved off:--  \"Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread. Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back.\"     CHAPTER XVII  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY--_continued_   When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram waiting for him:--       \"Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA      HARKER.\"  The Professor was delighted. \"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,\" he said, \"pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en route_, so that she may be prepared.\"  When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker\\'s diary at Whitby. \"Take these,\" he said, \"and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What is here told,\" he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, \"may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we shall go through all these together when we meet.\" He then made ready for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in.  The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and, after a quick glance, said: \"Dr. Seward, is it not?\"  \"And you are Mrs. Harker!\" I answered at once; whereupon she held out her hand.  \"I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----\" She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.  The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.  In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered.  She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here she is!   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward\\'s study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door, and on his calling out, \"Come in,\" I entered.  To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much interested.  \"I hope I did not keep you waiting,\" I said; \"but I stayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.\"  \"Oh,\" he replied with a smile, \"I was only entering my diary.\"  \"Your diary?\" I asked him in surprise.  \"Yes,\" he answered. \"I keep it in this.\" As he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--  \"Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?\"  \"Certainly,\" he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.  \"The fact is,\" he began awkwardly, \"I only keep my diary in it; and as it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that is, I mean----\" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his embarrassment:--  \"You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died; for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very dear to me.\"  To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--  \"Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!\"  \"Why not?\" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me. Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse. At length he stammered out:--  \"You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary.\" Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naÃ¯vetÃ© of a child: \"That\\'s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!\" I could not but smile, at which he grimaced. \"I gave myself away that time!\" he said. \"But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?\" By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and I said boldly:--  \"Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter.\" He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--  \"No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn\\'t let you know that terrible story!\"  Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking, followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.  \"You do not know me,\" I said. \"When you have read those papers--my own diary and my husband\\'s also, which I have typed--you will know me better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not expect you to trust me so far.\"  He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and said:--  \"You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you. But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better able to understand certain things.\" He carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which I know one side already....   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner, so I said: \"She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,\" and I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker\\'s diary, when she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--  \"I greatly fear I have distressed you.\"  \"Oh, no, not distressed me,\" she replied, \"but I have been more touched than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart. It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as I did.\"  \"No one need ever know, shall ever know,\" I said in a low voice. She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--  \"Ah, but they must!\"  \"Must! But why?\" I asked.  \"Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy\\'s death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know; but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us; working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark.\" She looked at me so appealingly, and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once to her wishes. \"You shall,\" I said, \"do as you like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor Lucy\\'s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the dark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come, there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us; we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were present.\"   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I put the forked metal to my ears and listened.  When the terrible story of Lucy\\'s death, and--and all that followed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan\\'s experience in Transylvania I could not have believed. As it was, I didn\\'t know what to believe, and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--  \"Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything, and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him when they come.\" He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor\\'s perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files of \"The Westminster Gazette\" and \"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" and took them to my room. I remember how much \"The Dailygraph\" and \"The Whitby Gazette,\" of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o\\'clock. He had got his wife\\'s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--and judging by one\\'s own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, business-like gentleman who came here to-day.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room, and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife\\'s typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it is....       Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be      the Count\\'s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues      from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters      relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,      if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!      Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again      collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be      able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the      meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of      index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,      but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing      that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have      found the dates otherwise....       I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands      folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any      one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of      subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own      accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my      knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite      confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I      not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of      his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a      brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All      those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the      Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that      his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire\\'s ultimate triumph?      Stay; he is himself zoÃ¶phagous, and in his wild ravings outside the      chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of \"master.\" This      all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came      away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it      safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,      and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so      I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to      have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.   _Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._  _29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington\\'s courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count\\'s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought me to his father\\'s house, where they had decided that I must stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality: give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count\\'s table before I knew of his diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out. To use an Americanism, he had \"taken no chances,\" and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it: \"Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.\" Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local tradition; but no one could add to the simple description \"Fifty cases of common earth.\" I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were \"main and mortal heavy,\" and that shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn\\'t any gentleman \"such-like as yourself, squire,\" to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach.         *       *       *       *       *  _30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station-master at King\\'s Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.  From thence I went on to Carter Paterson\\'s central office, where I met with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King\\'s Cross office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly; the carriers\\' men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--  \"That \\'ere \\'ouse, guv\\'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it ain\\'t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep\\' on it without \\'urtin\\' of yer bones; an\\' the place was that neglected that yer might \\'ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn\\'t never git out quick enough. Lor\\', I wouldn\\'t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.\"  Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.  Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at Whitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have since been removed--as from Dr. Seward\\'s diary I fear.  I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good deal.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers into order.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal_  _30 September._--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself. It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had: that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has, however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not human--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward\\'s account of poor Lucy\\'s death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one\\'s heart.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear Lucy\\'s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too, has been quite \"blowing my trumpet,\" as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward\\'s diary that they had been at Lucy\\'s death--her real death--and that I need not fear to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order. I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--  \"Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?\"  I nodded, and he went on:--  \"I don\\'t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--\" Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room. I suppose there is something in woman\\'s nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I hope he didn\\'t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I _know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking:--  \"I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won\\'t you let me be of some little service--for Lucy\\'s sake?\"  In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with emotion.  We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big sorrowing man\\'s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.  After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded, he could speak freely. \"I know now how I suffered,\" he said, as he dried his eyes, \"but I do not know even yet--and none other can ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy\\'s sake?\"  \"For dear Lucy\\'s sake,\" I said as we clasped hands. \"Ay, and for your own sake,\" he added, \"for if a man\\'s esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a man\\'s help, believe me, you will not call in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you will let me know.\" He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--  \"I promise.\"  As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window. He turned as he heard my footsteps. \"How is Art?\" he said. Then noticing my red eyes, he went on: \"Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.\"  He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise how much I knew; so I said to him:--  \"I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You will know, later on, why I speak.\" He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--  \"Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long as ever you live!\" Then he went into the study to his friend.  \"Little girl!\"--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he proved himself a friend!     CHAPTER XVIII  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY   _30 September._--I got home at five o\\'clock, and found that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers\\' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said:--  \"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary interests me so much!\" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: \"Why?\"  \"She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,\" I answered. \"Oh, very well,\" he said; \"let her come in, by all means; but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.\" His method of tidying was peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting task, he said cheerfully: \"Let the lady come in,\" and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.  \"Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,\" said she. \"You see, I know you, for Dr. Seward has told me of you.\" He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he said:--  \"You\\'re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can\\'t be, you know, for she\\'s dead.\" Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--  \"Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.\"  \"Then what are you doing here?\"  \"My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.\"  \"Then don\\'t stay.\"  \"But why not?\" I thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--  \"How did you know I wanted to marry any one?\" His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--  \"What an asinine question!\"  \"I don\\'t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,\" said Mrs. Harker, at once championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me:--  \"You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.\" I positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker\\'s presence which had touched some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or power.  We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things.  \"Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, \\'For the blood is the life.\\' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn\\'t that true, doctor?\" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: \"Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself,\" to which, to my astonishment, he replied:--  \"Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again. May He bless and keep you!\"  When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day.  Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--  \"Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!\"  As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker\\'s suggestion; at which the Professor interrupted me:--  \"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man\\'s brain--a brain that a man should have were he much gifted--and a woman\\'s heart. The good God fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides, she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and we go alone.\" I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him. \"Oh that we had known it before!\" he said, \"for then we might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, \\'the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,\\' as you say. We shall not think of that, but go on our way to the end.\" Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--  \"I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.\"  \"Not up to this moment, Professor,\" she said impulsively, \"but up to this morning.\"  \"But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who has told is the worse for it.\"  Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she said:--  \"Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except what is personal. Must it go in?\" The Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back, saying:--  \"It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more honour you--as well as more esteem and love.\" She took it back with another blush and a bright smile.  And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner, and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o\\'clock. The rest of us have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward\\'s study two hours after dinner, which had been at six o\\'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the centre. The Professor said:--  \"I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers.\" We all expressed assent, and he went on:--  \"Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me. So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure according.  \"There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. \\'See! see! I prove; I prove.\\' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay, had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God\\'s sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no; but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What say you?\"  Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man\\'s hand can speak for itself; it does not even need a woman\\'s love to hear its music.  When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I in his; there was no need for speaking between us.  \"I answer for Mina and myself,\" he said.  \"Count me in, Professor,\" said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.  \"I am with you,\" said Lord Godalming, \"for Lucy\\'s sake, if for no other reason.\"  Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life:--  \"Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally. In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.  \"Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.  \"All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never! He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble ship\\'s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell. He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature\\'s laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come; though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest. We have seen it with our eyes.  \"Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the \\'land beyond the forest.\\' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the records are such words as \\'stregoica\\'--witch, \\'ordog,\\' and \\'pokol\\'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as \\'wampyr,\\' which we all understand too well. There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.\"  Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window, and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little pause, and then the Professor went on:--  \"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the latter, we must trace----\"  Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris\\'s voice without:--  \"Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about it.\" A minute later he came in and said:--  \"It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.\"  \"Did you hit it?\" asked Dr. Van Helsing.  \"I don\\'t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.\" Without saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his statement:--  \"We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it. Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.  \"And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well. You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we are.\"  All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.  Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--  \"As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save another victim.\"  I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax, with means to get into the house.  Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me. I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--  \"He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don\\'t know but what, if you don\\'t see him soon, he will have one of his violent fits.\" I knew the man would not have said this without some cause, so I said: \"All right; I\\'ll go now\"; and I asked the others to wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my \"patient.\"  \"Take me with you, friend John,\" said the Professor. \"His case in your diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_ case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is disturbed.\"  \"May I come also?\" asked Lord Godalming.  \"Me too?\" said Quincey Morris. \"May I come?\" said Harker. I nodded, and we all went down the passage together.  We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity. \"I appeal to your friends,\" he said, \"they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have not introduced me.\" I was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and, besides, there was a certain dignity in the man\\'s manner, so much of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: \"Lord Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr. Renfield.\" He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--  \"Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties. And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances.\" He made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm.  I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the conviction, despite my knowledge of the man\\'s character and history, that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable. So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly:--  \"But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.\" He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--  \"Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?\"  \"You have,\" I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally. There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--  \"Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends.\" Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--  \"Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr. Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the privilege you seek.\" He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--  \"Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.\" He still shook his head as he said:--  \"Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.\" I thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying:--  \"Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.\"  As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--  \"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will; send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go out of this. You don\\'t know what you do by keeping me here. I am speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don\\'t know whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell. By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out of this and save my soul from guilt! Can\\'t you hear me, man? Can\\'t you understand? Will you never learn? Don\\'t you know that I am sane and earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!\"  I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.  \"Come,\" I said sternly, \"no more of this; we have had quite enough already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.\"  He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had expected.  When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a quiet, well-bred voice:--  \"You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.\"     CHAPTER XIX  JONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL   _1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work. Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward:--  \"Say, Jack, if that man wasn\\'t attempting a bluff, he is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw. I\\'m not sure, but I believe that he had some serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance.\" Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--  \"Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I\\'m glad of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say. All is best as they are.\" Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way:--  \"I don\\'t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can\\'t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count \\'lord and master,\\' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn\\'t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man.\" The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--  \"Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God?\" Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver whistle, as he remarked:--  \"That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I\\'ve got an antidote on call.\" Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--  \"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch. Keep this near your heart\"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--\"put these flowers round your neck\"--here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms--\"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless.\" This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others was similarly equipped. \"Now,\" he said, \"friend John, where are the skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house by the window, as before at Miss Lucy\\'s.\"  Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward\\'s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra\\'s tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door.  \"_In manus tuas, Domine!_\" he said, crossing himself as he passed over the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search.  The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.  The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider\\'s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them. He turned to me and said:--  \"You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?\" I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands. \"This is the spot,\" said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness.  Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.  We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we began:--  \"The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest.\" A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them.  There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the Count\\'s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, \"I thought I saw a face, but it was only the shadows,\" and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.  A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.  For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered from behind Dr. Seward\\'s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house. Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.  Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished.  With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.  The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front. Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done.  \"So far,\" he said, \"our night has been eminently successful. No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute beasts which are to the Count\\'s command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother\\'s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night. So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity to cry \\'check\\' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night\\'s work. It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril; but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.\"  The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield\\'s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.  I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep dark over to-night\\'s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.         *       *       *       *       *  _1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas Snelling to-day.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last night\\'s work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said:--  \"Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound.\" I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient. \"But,\" he answered, \"I want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?\"  \"Excuse me,\" I said, \"but the answer is here.\" I laid my hand on the type-written matter. \"When our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs. Harker entered the room.\" Van Helsing smiled in turn. \"Good!\" he said. \"Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?\" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study. \"Do I interrupt?\" he asked politely as he stood at the door.  \"Not at all,\" I answered. \"Come in. My work is finished, and I am free. I can go with you now, if you like.  \"It is needless; I have seen him!\"  \"Well?\"  \"I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short. When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. \"Don\\'t you know me?\" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: \"I know you well enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!\" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it is better so.\"  \"I agree with you with all my heart,\" I answered earnestly, for I did not want him to weaken in this matter. \"Mrs. Harker is better out of it. Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time infallibly have wrecked her.\"  So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day; after Jonathan\\'s full confidence for so many years, to see him manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Count\\'s house. And yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband\\'s great love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.  That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement.  Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told me to. I didn\\'t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored. If I hadn\\'t gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now. She hadn\\'t taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn\\'t come there in the day-time with me she wouldn\\'t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn\\'t gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn\\'t have destroyed her as he did. Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn....  I can\\'t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield\\'s room, which is somewhere under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window. All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears. I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.  I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words \"a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.\" Was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary\\'s Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one\\'s reason if there were too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night\\'s sleep. Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.         *       *       *       *       *  _2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing. In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan\\'s manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.     CHAPTER XX  JONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL   _1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog\\'s-eared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax.  He replied:--  \"Well, guv\\'nor, you\\'ve treated me wery \\'an\\'some\"--I had given him half a sovereign--\"an\\' I\\'ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the \\'Are an\\' \\'Ounds, in Pincher\\'s Alley, as \\'ow he an\\' his mate \\'ad \\'ad a rare dusty job in a old \\'ouse at Purfect. There ain\\'t a-many such jobs as this \\'ere, an\\' I\\'m thinkin\\' that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.\" I asked if he could tell me where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--  \"Look \\'ere, guv\\'nor, there ain\\'t no sense in me a-keepin\\' you \\'ere. I may find Sam soon, or I mayn\\'t; but anyhow he ain\\'t like to be in a way to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze. If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on it, I\\'ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But ye\\'d better be up arter \\'im soon in the mornin\\', or maybe ye won\\'t ketch \\'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.\"  This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home. We\\'re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as though she had been crying. Poor dear, I\\'ve no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.         *       *       *       *       *  _2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter\\'s pencil in a sprawling hand:--  \"Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for the depite.\"  I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her, but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home, with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter\\'s Court. Mr. Smollet\\'s spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter\\'s Court instead of Potter\\'s Court. However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran\\'s lodging-house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the \"depite,\" he shook his head, and said: \"I dunno \\'im. There ain\\'t no such a person \\'ere; I never \\'eard of \\'im in all my bloomin\\' days. Don\\'t believe there ain\\'t nobody of that kind livin\\' ere or anywheres.\" I took out Smollet\\'s letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me. \"What are you?\" I asked.  \"I\\'m the depity,\" he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the deputy\\'s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcoran\\'s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o\\'clock that morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a \"new-fangled ware\\'us\"; and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve o\\'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new \"cold storage\" building; and as this suited the condition of a \"new-fangled ware\\'us,\" I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his day\\'s wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--\"main heavy ones\"--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to which he replied:--  \"Well, guv\\'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a dusty old \\'ouse, too, though nothin\\' to the dustiness of the \\'ouse we tooked the bloomin\\' boxes from.\"  \"How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?\"  \"There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin\\' in the \\'ouse at Purfleet. He \\'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an\\' him a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn\\'t throw a shadder.\"  How this phrase thrilled through me!  \"Why, \\'e took up \\'is end o\\' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and me a-puffin\\' an\\' a-blowin\\' afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an\\' I\\'m no chicken, neither.\"  \"How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?\" I asked.  \"He was there too. He must \\'a\\' started off and got there afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem an\\' opened the door \\'isself an\\' \\'elped me to carry the boxes into the \\'all.\"  \"The whole nine?\" I asked.  \"Yus; there was five in the first load an\\' four in the second. It was main dry work, an\\' I don\\'t so well remember \\'ow I got \\'ome.\" I interrupted him:--  \"Were the boxes left in the hall?\"  \"Yus; it was a big \\'all, an\\' there was nothin\\' else in it.\" I made one more attempt to further matters:--  \"You didn\\'t have any key?\"  \"Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door \\'isself an\\' shut it again when I druv off. I don\\'t remember the last time--but that was the beer.\"  \"And you can\\'t remember the number of the house?\"  \"No, sir. But ye needn\\'t have no difficulty about that. It\\'s a \\'igh \\'un with a stone front with a bow on it, an\\' \\'igh steps up to the door. I know them steps, \\'avin\\' \\'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin\\'s, an\\' they seein\\' they got so much, they wanted more; but \\'e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw \\'im down the steps, till the lot of them went away cussin\\'.\" I thought that with this description I could find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining. Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house.  There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken, but he couldn\\'t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to very lately there had been a notice-board of \"For Sale\" up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.  The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a \"mansion\"--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying:--  \"It is sold, sir.\"  \"Pardon me,\" I said, with equal politeness, \"but I have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it.\"  Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. \"It is sold, sir,\" was again his laconic reply.  \"Surely,\" I said, \"you do not mind letting me know so much.\"  \"But I do mind,\" he answered. \"The affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.\" This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--  \"Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence. I am myself a professional man.\" Here I handed him my card. \"In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was, he understood, lately for sale.\" These words put a different complexion on affairs. He said:--  \"I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship\\'s address I will consult the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his lordship by to-night\\'s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship.\"  I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward\\'s and came away. It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the AÃ«rated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet by the next train.  I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing knowledge would be torture to her.  I could not tell the others of the day\\'s discovery till we were alone; so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed. The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us.  When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--  \"This has been a great day\\'s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the wretch to his real death.\" We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morris spoke:--  \"Say! how are we going to get into that house?\"  \"We got into the other,\" answered Lord Godalming quickly.  \"But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don\\'t see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning.\" Lord Godalming\\'s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us:--  \"Quincey\\'s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we can find the Count\\'s key basket.\"  As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell\\'s, we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....  Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny. He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked him:--  \"What about the flies these times?\" He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as he answered me:--  \"The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical of the aÃ«rial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly!\"  I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said quickly:--  \"Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?\" His madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--  \"Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.\" Here he brightened up; \"I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to study zoÃ¶phagy!\"  This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--  \"Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?\" He smiled with an ineffably benign superiority.  \"Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied spiritually!\" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall Enoch\\'s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--  \"And why with Enoch?\"  \"Because he walked with God.\" I could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--  \"So you don\\'t care about life and you don\\'t want souls. Why not?\" I put my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him. The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as he replied:--  \"I don\\'t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don\\'t. I couldn\\'t use them if I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn\\'t eat them or----\" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. \"And doctor, as to life, what is it after all? When you\\'ve got all you require, and you know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good friends--like you, Dr. Seward\"; this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning. \"I know that I shall never lack the means of life!\"  I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as he--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.  Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were alone.  I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his lips:--  \"What about souls?\" It was evident then that my surmise had been correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. \"What about them yourself?\" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer.  \"I don\\'t want any souls!\" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to \"be cruel only to be kind.\" So I said:--  \"You like life, and you want life?\"  \"Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn\\'t worry about that!\"  \"But,\" I asked, \"how are we to get the life without getting the soul also?\" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--  \"A nice time you\\'ll have some time when you\\'re flying out there, with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you. You\\'ve got their lives, you know, and you must put up with their souls!\" Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--  \"Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?\" He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--  \"Not much! flies are poor things, after all!\" After a pause he added, \"But I don\\'t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.\"  \"Or spiders?\" I went on.  \"Blow spiders! What\\'s the use of spiders? There isn\\'t anything in them to eat or\"--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden topic.  \"So, so!\" I thought to myself, \"this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word \\'drink\\'; what does it mean?\" Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention from it:--  \"I don\\'t take any stock at all in such matters. \\'Rats and mice and such small deer,\\' as Shakespeare has it, \\'chicken-feed of the larder\\' they might be called. I\\'m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before me.\"  \"I see,\" I said. \"You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?\"  \"What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!\" He was getting too wide awake, so I thought I would press him hard. \"I wonder,\" I said reflectively, \"what an elephant\\'s soul is like!\"  The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his high-horse and became a child again.  \"I don\\'t want an elephant\\'s soul, or any soul at all!\" he said. For a few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. \"To hell with you and your souls!\" he shouted. \"Why do you plague me about souls? Haven\\'t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already, without thinking of souls!\" He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--  \"Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am sure you will understand!\" He had evidently self-control; so when the attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable dignity and sweetness:--  \"Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that I am very, very grateful to you!\" I thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in this man\\'s state. Several points seem to make what the American interviewer calls \"a story,\" if one could only get them in proper order. Here they are:--  Will not mention \"drinking.\"  Fears the thought of being burdened with the \"soul\" of anything.  Has no dread of wanting \"life\" in the future.  Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being haunted by their souls.  Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!  And the assurance--?  Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of terror afoot!         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come away as ignorant as we went in.  His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.   _Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming._  _\"1 October._  \"My Lord,  \"We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes \\'over the counter,\\' if your Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever of him.  \"We are, my Lord,  \"Your Lordship\\'s humble servants,  \"MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield\\'s room, and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire in the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result, and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.  Before going to bed I went round to the patient\\'s room and looked in through the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart rose and fell with regular respiration.  This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having \"dozed\" for a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched.  To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept, and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later.  I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait-waistcoats.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if Renfield\\'s quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a valuable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- That wild yell seemed to come from his room....         *       *       *       *       *  The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had somehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood. I must go at once....     CHAPTER XXI  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY   _3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.  When I came to Renfield\\'s room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries; there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over:--  \"I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed.\" How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--  \"I can\\'t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink. But for the life of me I can\\'t imagine how the two things occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn\\'t beat his head; and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it.\" I said to him:--  \"Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want him without an instant\\'s delay.\" The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--  \"Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself. If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.\"  The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me:--  \"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes conscious, after the operation.\" So I said:--  \"I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate. Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\"  The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient. The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The Professor thought a moment and said:--  \"We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be too late.\" As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--  \"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident. So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times. I\\'ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things as they have been. We\\'ll have to look back--and forward a little more than we have done. May we come in?\" I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly:--  \"My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!\" I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched in patience.  \"We shall wait,\" said Van Helsing, \"just long enough to fix the best spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot; for it is evident that the hÃ¦morrhage is increasing.\"  The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing\\'s face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think; but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the death-watch. The poor man\\'s breathing came in uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it.  At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke:--  \"There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake! We shall operate just above the ear.\"  Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest. Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved convulsively, and as he did so, said:--  \"I\\'ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot move. What\\'s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully.\" He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--  \"Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.\" As he heard the voice his face brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--  \"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed\"--he stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--\"The brandy--it is in my study--quick!\" He flew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I shall never forget, and said:--  \"I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.\" Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--  \"If I were not sure already, I would know from them.\" For an instant his eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said, hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--  \"Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes; and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn\\'t speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\" As he spoke, Van Helsing\\'s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly and said: \"Go on,\" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--  \"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before; but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a man\\'s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn\\'t ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along. Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.\" He was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--  \"How?\"  \"By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their backs.\" Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--  \"The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the \\'Death\\'s-head Moth\\'?\" The patient went on without stopping.  \"Then he began to whisper: \\'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely buzzing flies!\\' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do. Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he seemed to be saying: \\'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!\\' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash and saying to Him: \\'Come in, Lord and Master!\\' The rats were all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour.\"  His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \"Let him go on. Do not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought.\" He proceeded:--  \"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him. When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn\\'t even smell the same as he went by me. I couldn\\'t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had come into the room.\"  The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better. They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without noticing:--  \"When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn\\'t the same; it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.\" Here we all moved, but no one said a word; he went on:--  \"I didn\\'t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn\\'t look the same. I don\\'t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn\\'t think of it at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her.\" I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. \"So when He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power. Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn\\'t mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away under the door.\" His voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.  \"We know the worst now,\" he said. \"He is here, and we know his purpose. It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.\" There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Count\\'s house. The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--  \"They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with. Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!\" He stopped; his voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart.  Outside the Harkers\\' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the latter said:--  \"Should we disturb her?\"  \"We must,\" said Van Helsing grimly. \"If the door be locked, I shall break it in.\"  \"May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady\\'s room!\"  Van Helsing said solemnly, \"You are always right; but this is life and death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you too, my friends. Now!\"  He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck, and my heart seemed to stand still.  The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker\\'s hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man\\'s bare breast which was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten\\'s nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey\\'s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count\\'s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--  \"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers herself; I must wake him!\" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the instant I heard Harker\\'s quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly, however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.  \"In God\\'s name what does this mean?\" Harker cried out. \"Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear, what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to this!\" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together. \"Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!\" With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. \"What has happened? Tell me all about it!\" he cried without pausing. \"Dr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!\" His wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--  \"No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!\" Her expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.  Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--  \"Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm and take counsel together.\" She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husband\\'s breast. When she raised it, his white night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs:--  \"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have most cause to fear.\" To this he spoke out resolutely:--  \"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!\" He put out his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost:--  \"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad fact; tell me all that has been.\" I told him exactly what had happened, and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door. They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming answered:--  \"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had, however----\" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--  \"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now is in knowing all. Tell freely!\" So Art went on:--  \"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax had helped the flames.\" Here I interrupted. \"Thank God there is the other copy in the safe!\" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on: \"I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked into Renfield\\'s room; but there was no trace there except----!\" Again he paused. \"Go on,\" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue, added: \"except that the poor fellow is dead.\" Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly:--  \"God\\'s will be done!\" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing. Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--  \"And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?\"  \"A little,\" he answered. \"It may be much eventually, but at present I can\\'t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from Renfield\\'s window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!\"  He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker\\'s head:--  \"And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and learn.\"  The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly. After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she began:--  \"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.\" Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly: \"Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary\\'s Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--  \"\\'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes.\\' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so, \\'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!\\' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!\" Her husband groaned again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the injured one, and went on:--  \"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I saw it drip with the fresh blood!\" The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husband\\'s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and went on:--  \"Then he spoke to me mockingly, \\'And so you, like the others, would play your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already, and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were born--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my call. When my brain says \"Come!\" to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding; and to that end this!\\' With that he pulled open his shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril; and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!\" Then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.  As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken, and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet; but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair.  We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.  Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course.     CHAPTER XXII  JONATHAN HARKER\\'S JOURNAL   _3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It is now six o\\'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However, we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!  When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.  Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield had called out loudly several times, \"God! God! God!\" after that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing asked if he had heard \"voices\" or \"a voice,\" and he said he could not say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear to it, if required, that the word \"God\" was spoken by the patient. Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As it was, he thought that on the attendant\\'s evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result.  When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of despair. \"There must be no concealment,\" she said, \"Alas! we have had too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now! Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!\" Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly:--  \"But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened?\" Her face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered:--  \"Ah no! for my mind is made up!\"  \"To what?\" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--  \"Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of harm to any that I love, I shall die!\"  \"You would not kill yourself?\" he asked, hoarsely.  \"I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a pain, and so desperate an effort!\" She looked at him meaningly as she spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:  \"My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my child----\" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his throat; he gulped it down and went on:--  \"There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.\" The poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--  \"I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may have passed away from me.\" She was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before. She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if \"pleased\" could be used in connection with so grim an interest.  As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work.  \"It is perhaps well,\" he said, \"that at our meeting after our visit to Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours; and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.\" Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina\\'s life and happiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly. \"Nay, friend Jonathan,\" he said, \"in this, the quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly. The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet, where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt \\'stop the earths\\' and so we run down our old fox--so? is it not?\"  \"Then let us come at once,\" I cried, \"we are wasting the precious, precious time!\" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--  \"And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?\"  \"Any way!\" I cried. \"We shall break in if need be.\"  \"And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?\"  I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--  \"Don\\'t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am in.\"  \"Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?\" I nodded.  \"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?\"  \"I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the lock for me.\"  \"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?\"  \"Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.\"  \"Then,\" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, \"all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice; and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done _en rÃ¨gle_; and in our work we shall be _en rÃ¨gle_ too. We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten o\\'clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house.\"  I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina\\'s face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van Helsing went on:--  \"When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.\"  Lord Godalming stood up. \"I can be of some use here,\" he said. \"I shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient.\"  \"Look here, old fellow,\" said Morris, \"it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don\\'t you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes? It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.\"  \"Friend Quincey is right!\" said the Professor. \"His head is what you call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.\"  Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear.  When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the Count\\'s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us some new clue.  As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly; that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them. It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count\\'s papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania; and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Count\\'s extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina\\'s resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that we should all work together. \"As for me,\" she said, \"I have no fear. Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.\" So I started up crying out: \"Then in God\\'s name let us come at once, for we are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we think.\"  \"Not so!\" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.  \"But why?\" I asked.  \"Do you forget,\" he said, with actually a smile, \"that last night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?\"  Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. \"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, \"dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will forget it, will you not?\" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--  \"No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we may be strong.\"  Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--  \"Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy\\'s lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?\" We all assured him. \"Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father, the Son, and----\"  There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he had placed the Wafer on Mina\\'s forehead, it had seared it--had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor darling\\'s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--  \"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.\" They all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--  \"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God\\'s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man.\"  There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation. Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old man\\'s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.  It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.  To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.  We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last. Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--  \"And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to God.\" As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.  One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion of the Host.  When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--  \"So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam Mina\\'s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!\"  As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the platform.  I have written this in the train.         *       *       *       *       *  _Piccadilly, 12:30 o\\'clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street Lord Godalming said to me:--  \"Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it wouldn\\'t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better.\" I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went on: \"Besides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park, somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let you in.\"  \"The advice is good!\" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others.  At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done. The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing\\'s went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock. This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.  When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.  \"The place smells so vilely,\" said the latter as we came in. It did indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought! Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his effects.  After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle; deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey; note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of the Count.     CHAPTER XXIII  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY   _3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker. The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see. Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So well as I can remember, here it is:--  \"I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete. In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of man\\'s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life.\"  Harker groaned and said, \"And this is all arrayed against my darling! But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!\"  \"He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.\"  \"I fail to understand,\" said Harker wearily. \"Oh, do be more plain to me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.\"  The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--  \"Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been making use of the zoÃ¶phagous patient to effect his entry into friend John\\'s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him; and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are five of us when those absent ones return.\"  Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the double postman\\'s knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the direction, opened it and read aloud.  \"Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want to see you: Mina.\"  There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker\\'s voice:--  \"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!\" Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said:--  \"God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.\"  \"I care for nothing now,\" he answered hotly, \"except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!\"  \"Oh, hush, hush, my child!\" said Van Helsing. \"God does not purchase souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man, and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.\"  About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker\\'s telegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor\\'s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the hall:--  \"It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we destroyed them all!\"  \"Destroyed?\" asked the Professor.  \"For him!\" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--  \"There\\'s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn\\'t turn up by five o\\'clock, we must start off; for it won\\'t do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset.\"  \"He will be here before long now,\" said Van Helsing, who had been consulting his pocket-book. \"_Nota bene_, in Madam\\'s telegram he went south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one o\\'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your arms! Be ready!\" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.  I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door. Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least he feared it.  Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count\\'s leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out. The expression of the Count\\'s face was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over the Count\\'s face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker\\'s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the \"ting\" of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging.  We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door. There he turned and spoke to us:--  \"You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like sheep in a butcher\\'s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed. Bah!\" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.  \"We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he return.\" As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with a match.  Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however, bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.  It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the Professor when he said:--  \"Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find it; when that is done all may yet be well.\" I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he was thinking of his wife.  With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--  \"I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!\" As she spoke, she took her husband\\'s grey head in her hands and kissed it--\"Lay your poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect us if He so will it in His good intent.\" The poor fellow groaned. There was no place for words in his sublime misery.  We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to her husband\\'s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up to the present time. Then without letting go her husband\\'s hand she stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and purity and faith, was outcast from God.  \"Jonathan,\" she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness, \"Jonathan dear, and you all my true, true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter; but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may not hold your hands from his destruction.\"  As she spoke I could see her husband\\'s face darken and draw together, as though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core. Instinctively the clasp on his wife\\'s hand grew closer, till his knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke:--  \"May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!\"  \"Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don\\'t say such things, Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that ... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh, my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come.\"  We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed. Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone with their God.  Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace. She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her husband\\'s sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was, I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency. When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in, for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go to bed.   _Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._  _3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end. There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the meantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now. This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March. I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep; for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me until....         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily, for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--  \"Hush! there is someone in the corridor!\" I got up softly, and crossing the room, gently opened the door.  Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--  \"Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all night. We don\\'t mean to take any chances!\"  His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina. She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly:--  \"Oh, thank God for good brave men!\" With a sigh she sank back again to sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.         *       *       *       *       *  _4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened by Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--  \"Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.\"  \"Why?\" I asked.  \"I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured without my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.\" I went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing me, he sprang to his feet.  \"Is anything wrong?\" he asked, in alarm.  \"No,\" I replied; \"but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.\"  \"I will go,\" he said, and hurried into the Professor\\'s room.  In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he said:--  \"Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan, we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!\" Then turning to her, he said, cheerfully: \"And what am I do for you? For at this hour you do not want me for nothings.\"  \"I want you to hypnotise me!\" she said. \"Do it before the dawn, for I feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is short!\" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.  Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her, from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in. They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The stillness was broken by Van Helsing\\'s voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts:--  \"Where are you?\" The answer came in a neutral way:--  \"I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.\" For several minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina\\'s face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--  \"Where are you now?\" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes.  \"I do not know. It is all strange to me!\"  \"What do you see?\"  \"I can see nothing; it is all dark.\"  \"What do you hear?\" I could detect the strain in the Professor\\'s patient voice.  \"The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can hear them on the outside.\"  \"Then you are on a ship?\" We all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came quick:--  \"Oh, yes!\"  \"What else do you hear?\"  \"The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the rachet.\"  \"What are you doing?\"  \"I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!\" The voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.  By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina\\'s shoulders, and laid her head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her. \"Have I been talking in my sleep?\" was all she said. She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the conversation, and she said:--  \"Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!\" Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor\\'s calm voice called them back:--  \"Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men, since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the Count\\'s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan\\'s so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need, and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us.\" Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--  \"But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?\" He took her hand and patted it as he replied:--  \"Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all questions.\" He would say no more, and we separated to dress.  After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully:--  \"Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!\" She grew paler as she asked faintly:--  \"Why?\"  \"Because,\" he answered solemnly, \"he can live for centuries, and you are but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that mark upon your throat.\"  I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.     CHAPTER XXIV  DR. SEWARD\\'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING   This to Jonathan Harker.  You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our search--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we seek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day. This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already, for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him. But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last resource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_. He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and so he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came, and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound; when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope when you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do. But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is but begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on high to watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.  VAN HELSING.   _Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._  _4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing\\'s message in the phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort; and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to believe in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight----  Alas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darling\\'s white forehead. Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting. Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may be! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other yet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and the others after their investigations.  The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run for me again. It is now three o\\'clock.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker.  Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--  \"As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd\\'s, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go out with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from Doolittle\\'s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the Danube. \\'Soh!\\' said I, \\'this is the ship whereon is the Count.\\' So off we go to Doolittle\\'s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.  \"They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five o\\'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be. But he say \\'no\\'; that he come not yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him that he doesn\\'t want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms, he departed.  \"No one knew where he went \\'or bloomin\\' well cared,\\' as they said, for they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her. The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and blood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him. Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain\\'s swears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.  \"And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part. When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say \\'no\\'; for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own way.\"  When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: \"We have the best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning.\" I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion, at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men:--  \"Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and so in time, death, which is of man\\'s common lot and with God\\'s sanction, shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God\\'s own wish: that the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause.\" He paused and I said:--  \"But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted?\"  \"Aha!\" he said, \"your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again. Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God.\"  After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we shall decide on some definite cause of action.         *       *       *       *       *  I feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting presence were removed from me. Perhaps ...  My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still unclean.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again.  It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker\\'s forehead that I was brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker\\'s tongue is tied. I _know_ that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called \"the Vampire\\'s baptism of blood.\" Well, there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker\\'s silences, then there is a terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!  Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall try to open the subject with him.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--  \"Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence\"; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--  \"Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.\" A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing continued:--  \"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?\" I nodded acquiescence; he went on:--  \"Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be. When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by us.\" He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the effect was as I expected.  It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--  \"The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days. Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship\\'s voyage, owing to such weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us, then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.\" Here Quincey Morris added:--  \"I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn\\'t we have given then for a repeater apiece!\"  \"Good!\" said Van Helsing, \"Winchesters it shall be. Quincey\\'s head is level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there. To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we four can set out on our journey.\"  \"We four?\" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us.  \"Of course!\" answered the Professor quickly, \"you must remain to take care of your so sweet wife!\" Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice:--  \"Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with Mina.\" I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away.   _Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._  _5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina\\'s determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina\\'s happy sleep, and came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--  \"Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A promise made to me, but made holily in God\\'s hearing, and not to be broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.\"  \"Mina,\" I said, \"a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have no right to make it.\"  \"But, dear one,\" she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars, \"it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself. You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved from the promise.\"  \"I promise!\" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead. She said:--  \"Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!\" and she solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said solemnly:--  \"I promise!\" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening. So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care. Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.         *       *       *       *       *  _6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.  \"No,\" she said quite simply, \"it will not be necessary. You can tell them just as well. I must go with you on your journey.\"  Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment\\'s pause he asked:--  \"But why?\"  \"You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer, too.\"  \"But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.\" He paused, embarrassed.  As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--  \"I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan.\" God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of tears. She went on:--  \"You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even I myself do not know.\" Dr. Van Helsing said very gravely:--  \"Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.\" When he had spoken, Mina\\'s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also. He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--  \"In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.\"  \"What shall we do exactly?\" asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor paused before replying:--  \"We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was man\\'s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then, when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the box, and--and all will be well.\"  \"I shall not wait for any opportunity,\" said Morris. \"When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!\" I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel. I think he understood my look; I hope he did.  \"Good boy,\" said Dr. Van Helsing. \"Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But, indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey.\"  There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she survive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder.  It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina\\'s uneasiness calls my attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger--some new pain, which, however, may in God\\'s will be means to a good end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they shall be ready.  She is calling to me.     CHAPTER XXV  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY   _11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.  I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom; when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.  To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband\\'s hand in hers began:--  \"We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know, dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end.\" This was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. \"In the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate at stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are. There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!\" She looked appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.  \"What is that way?\" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. \"What is that way, which we must not--may not--take?\"  \"That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy\\'s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God\\'s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!\" We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The faces of the others were set and Harker\\'s grew ashen grey; perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--  \"This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.\" I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all seriousness. \"What will each of you give? Your lives I know,\" she went on quickly, \"that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God\\'s, and you can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?\" She looked again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband\\'s face. Quincey seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. \"Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you, my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.\"  \"What is that time?\" The voice was Quincey\\'s, but it was low and strained.  \"When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment\\'s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head; or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!\"  Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--  \"I\\'m only a rough fellow, who hasn\\'t, perhaps, lived as a man should to win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!\"  \"My true friend!\" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as, bending over, she kissed his hand.  \"I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!\" said Van Helsing.  \"And I!\" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair, and asked:--  \"And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?\"  \"You too, my dearest,\" she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes. \"You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men\\'s duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy\\'s case to him who loved\"--she stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase--\"to him who had best right to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory of my husband\\'s life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me.\"  \"Again I swear!\" came the Professor\\'s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and said:--  \"And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget: this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a time I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued with your enemy against you.\"  \"One more request;\" she became very solemn as she said this, \"it is not vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for me, if you will.\" We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need to speak:--  \"I want you to read the Burial Service.\" She was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her heart, and continued: \"You must read it over me some day. Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!\"  \"But oh, my dear one,\" he pleaded, \"death is afar off from you.\"  \"Nay,\" she said, holding up a warning hand. \"I am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!\"  \"Oh, my wife, must I read it?\" he said, before he began.  \"It would comfort me, my husband!\" was all she said; and he began to read when she had got the book ready.  \"How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband\\'s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!\"         *       *       *       *       *  She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker\\'s coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded.   _Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._  _15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five o\\'clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--\"the Odessus.\" The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world. Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--  \"Nothing; all is dark.\" And to the second:--  \"I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.\" It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect: that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd\\'s from anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.  We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man\\'s form without suspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy; for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy, before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!         *       *       *       *       *  _16 October._--Mina\\'s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and when we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she must pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.         *       *       *       *       *  _17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming\\'s kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count\\'s body, it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the _Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.         *       *       *       *       *  _24 October._--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming, but only the same story: \"Not yet reported.\" Mina\\'s morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.  _Telegram, October 24th._  _Rufus Smith, Lloyd\\'s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M. Vice-Consul, Varna._  \"_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd\\'s. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It would break poor Harker\\'s heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate. \"Euthanasia\" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever invented it.  It is only about 24 hours\\' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should therefore arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one o\\'clock, so as to be ready.         *       *       *       *       *  _25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship\\'s arrival. Mrs. Harker\\'s hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that \"Kukri\" ever touches his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!  Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To his doom, I trust!         *       *       *       *       *  _26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_. She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is apparent, for Mrs. Harker\\'s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog; some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.         *       *       *       *       *  _27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for. Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: \"lapping waves and rushing water,\" though she added that \"the waves were very faint.\" The telegrams from London have been the same: \"no further report.\" Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--  \"I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina\\'s. Souls and memories can do strange things during trance.\" I was about to ask him more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.         *       *       *       *       *       _28 October._--Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,      care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._       \"_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o\\'clock      to-day.\"   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen. The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o\\'-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our old wandering days it meant \"action.\" Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there. \"When does the next train start for Galatz?\" said Van Helsing to us generally.  \"At 6:30 to-morrow morning!\" We all started, for the answer came from Mrs. Harker.  \"How on earth do you know?\" said Art.  \"You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so does Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn, as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.\"  \"Wonderful woman!\" murmured the Professor.  \"Can\\'t we get a special?\" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his head: \"I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think. Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make report.\"  \"And I,\" said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day, \"shall try to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!\" The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the time, however.  When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs. Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of Harker\\'s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door was shut upon her he said to me:--  \"We mean the same! speak out!\"  \"There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may deceive us.\"  \"Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?\"  \"No!\" said I, \"unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.\"  \"You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk; but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box. Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.  \"He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call; but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance! She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great brain which is trained like man\\'s brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away altogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!\"  I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:--  \"Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the \"Ugly Duck\" of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I read here what Jonathan have written:--  \"That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.\"  \"What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count\\'s child-thought see nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature\\'s course they move on their way and they touch--then pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime? \\'Yes\\' and \\'No.\\' You, John, yes; for it is a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad universale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other. This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start from to do more. \\'_Dos pou sto_,\\' said Archimedes. \\'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!\\' To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,\" for Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--  \"Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes.\" He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke. His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke:--  \"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and _quÃ¢_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind. Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a \\'tight place,\\' he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won. So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from Turkey Land.\"  \"Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!\" said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room consultation:--  \"Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.\" Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation:--  \"But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid; John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right. Speak, without fear!\"  \"I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.\"  \"Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.\"  \"Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends.\" The Professor stood up:--  \"He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us. But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in God\\'s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his; and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.\"  And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.     CHAPTER XXVI  DR. SEWARD\\'S DIARY   _29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--  \"I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear men\\'s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away. There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air blowing upon me.\"  Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding. Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harker\\'s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--  \"Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!\" We could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--  \"You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him. We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.\"  There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn; at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.  Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made reply:--  \"All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as of wood on wood.\" She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till to-night.  And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning; but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count\\'s sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count\\'s power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did speak, her words were enigmatical:--  \"Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.\" She stopped and a shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even in answer to the Professor\\'s imperative questioning. When she woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said; when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence.         *       *       *       *       *  _30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all. Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--  \"All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a queer one like----\" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.  \"Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!\" said Van Helsing in an agonised voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker\\'s pale face. She opened her eyes, and we all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern:--  \"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can\\'t? I don\\'t remember anything.\" Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look:--  \"What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was lying here, half asleep, and heard you say go on! speak, I command you!\\' It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child!\"  \"Oh, Madam Mina,\" he said, sadly, \"it is proof, if proof be needed, of how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to obey!\"  The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with anxiety and eagerness.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the _Czarina Catherine_.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk. He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.   _Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._  _30 October._--At nine o\\'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord Godalming\\'s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in their power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run.  \"Man!\" he said, \"but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi\\' some rare piece o\\' ill luck, so as to keep up the average. It\\'s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi\\' a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin\\' on yer sail for his ain purpose. An\\' a\\' the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi\\' us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi\\'oot bein\\' able to signal; an\\' till we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o\\' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi\\' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an\\' the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin\\' him.\" This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--  \"Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and he know when he meet his match!\" The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on:--  \"When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o\\' them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin\\' old man just before we had started frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn\\'t say it was agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn\\'t let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres--well, he would fetch it up a\\'reet. An\\' if he didn\\'t, well, we\\'d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin\\' sun came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz. The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi\\' them aboot it wi\\' a handspike; an\\' when the last o\\' them rose off the deck wi\\' his head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I\\'d let it lie till we discharged in the port an\\' get rid o\\'t althegither. We didn\\'t do much clearin\\' that day, an\\' had to remain the nicht at anchor; but in the mornin\\', braw an\\' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came aboard wi\\' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand. He had his papers a\\' reet, an\\' glad I was to be rid o\\' the dam\\' thing, for I was beginnin\\' masel\\' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I\\'m thinkin\\' it was nane ither than that same!\"  \"What was the name of the man who took it?\" asked Dr. Van Helsing with restrained eagerness.  \"I\\'ll be tellin\\' ye quick!\" he answered, and, stepping down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed \"Immanuel Hildesheim.\" Burgen-strasse 16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so with thanks we came away.  We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all he knew.  We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten and eleven o\\'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.  Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out \"This is the work of a Slovak!\" We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.  As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina.  When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to her.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _30 October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the \"Traveller\\'s\" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for me. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write with a pen....  It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered, what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh! if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.  I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I have not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to follow the Professor\\'s example, and think without prejudice on the facts before me....         *       *       *       *       *  I do believe that under God\\'s providence I have made a discovery. I shall get the maps and look over them....         *       *       *       *       *  I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, so I shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it is well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.   _Mina Harker\\'s Memorandum._  (Entered in her Journal.)  _Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula\\'s problem is to get back to his own place.  (_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.  (_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may help us. By road, by rail, by water?  1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the city.  (_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.  (_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.  (_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even his victim--me!  2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.  3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would still be desperate.  We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do is to ascertain _what_ water.  The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may, then, get a light on what his later task is to be.  _Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.  _Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of, what he has done here.  As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.  That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_ made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson\\'s suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness played the Count\\'s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the Count\\'s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.  Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on land_, at Galatz.  The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work? In my husband\\'s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man\\'s remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.  My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.  I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There would be no such sound if floating down stream.  Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula\\'s castle as can be got by water.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal--continued._  When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--  \"Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where we were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men, to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all shall do.\"  \"I shall get a steam launch and follow him,\" said Lord Godalming.  \"And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,\" said Mr. Morris.  \"Good!\" said the Professor, \"both good. But neither must go alone. There must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and rough, and he carries rude arms.\" All the men smiled, for amongst them they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--  \"I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.\" Dr. Seward said:--  \"I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don\\'t suppose these fellows carry guns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we shall not rest until the Count\\'s head and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.\" He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ... the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--  \"Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy\\'s country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam Mina\\'s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.\" Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--  \"Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil\\'s illness, right into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or Hell!\" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--  \"Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo? Have you felt the Vampire\\'s lips upon your throat?\" Here he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry: \"Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!\" and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor\\'s voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all:--  \"Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that place. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then in time our dear one\"--he took my hand--\"would come to him to keep him company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving, possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I who would have to go to keep them company.\"  \"Do as you will,\" said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, \"we are in the hands of God!\"         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked. How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money! What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment\\'s notice. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as warnings.         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly; his look is a warning. There must be no tears now--unless it may be that God will let them fall in gladness.   _Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._  _October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our plans, we finally decided that Mina\\'s guess was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count\\'s escape back to his Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started; they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.  It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the furnace door....         *       *       *       *       *  _31 October._--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and prayed.         *       *       *       *       *  _1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of the kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and me.         *       *       *       *       *  _2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _2 November._--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully. Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on; we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.         *       *       *       *       *  _3 November._--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the Bistritza. I wish it wasn\\'t so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and if it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and go on, Russian fashion.         *       *       *       *       *  _4 November._--To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I could say was: \"dark and quiet.\" He is off now buying a carriage and horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so that we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to see it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint people! But, alas!--         *       *       *       *       *  _Later._--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough for a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of our being cold.         *       *       *       *       *  We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are truly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him, with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him.     CHAPTER XXVII  MINA HARKER\\'S JOURNAL   _1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can\\'t abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he says that I answered as usual \"darkness, lapping water and creaking wood\"; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror\\'s; even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us, and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.         *       *       *       *       *  _2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving all night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange heaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered \"darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,\" so the river is changing as they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of danger--more than need be; but we are in God\\'s hands.         *       *       *       *       *  _2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both, and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred His wrath.   _Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._  _4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept alive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well. However, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well, God\\'s will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!  Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go unrecorded.  We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As before, came the answer: \"darkness and the swirling of water.\" Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass. At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--  \"This is the way.\"  \"How know you it?\" I ask.  \"Of course I know it,\" she answer, and with a pause, add: \"Have not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?\"  At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and more of use.  So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow have fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep. For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though it were the end of the world.  Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down. Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake, and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we first enter the Count\\'s house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter, to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.         *       *       *       *       *  _5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.  All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism. \"Well,\" said I to myself, \"if it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night.\" As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill, the end was near.  I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet:--  \"Will you not come over to the fire?\" for I wished to make a test of what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken.  \"Why not go on?\" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply:--  \"I cannot!\" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!  Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan\\'s horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:--  \"No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!\" I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said:--  \"But you? It is for you that I fear!\" whereat she laughed--a laugh, low and unreal, and said:--  \"Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them than I am,\" and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead. Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--  \"Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!\" In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror.  And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again. At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle, and were lost.  Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to me a safety.  I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her sleep....   _Jonathan Harker\\'s Journal._  _4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago; and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her, off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only Morris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more Good-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.   _Dr. Seward\\'s Diary._  _5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing away from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready, and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who, or where, or what, or when, or how it may be....   _Dr. Van Helsing\\'s Memorandum._  _5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle. The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that being entered I might not get out. Jonathan\\'s bitter experience served me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves. Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight. The dilemma had me between his horns.  Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God\\'s will. At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.  I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...  There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing, with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.  Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent. There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and nobly proportioned. On it was but one word                                  DRACULA.  This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew. Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work, I laid in Dracula\\'s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.  Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....  Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud \"I am here!\"  Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can the Count enter there Un-Dead.  When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.  \"Come!\" she said, \"come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us.\" She was looking thin and pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.  And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet our friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are coming to meet us.   _Mina Harker\\'s Journal._  _6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula\\'s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we could trace it through the drifted snow.  In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the hand and drew me in: \"See!\" he said, \"here you will be in shelter; and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.\" He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--  \"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!\" I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog\\'s tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the men\\'s clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.  On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation, however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--  \"At least you shall be safe here from _him_!\" He took the glasses from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us. \"See,\" he said, \"they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and galloping as hard as they can.\" He paused and went on in a hollow voice:--  \"They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God\\'s will be done!\" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--  \"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow blots it all out!\" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan. At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter. \"They are all converging,\" he said. \"When the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.\" I got out my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again. It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.  Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm\\'s length before us; but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops.  Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our presence.  All at once two voices shouted out to: \"Halt!\" One was my Jonathan\\'s, raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris\\' strong resolute tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them. Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.  The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand. For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.  In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention. Jonathan\\'s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.  By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well.  As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph.  But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan\\'s great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris\\'s bowie knife plunged into the heart.  It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight.  I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there.  The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun.  The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone.  Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--  \"I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!\" he cried suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, \"It was worth for this to die! Look! look!\"  The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest \"Amen\" broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man spoke:--  \"Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!\"  And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a gallant gentleman.                                       NOTE   Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy\\'s birthday is the same day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the secret belief that some of our brave friend\\'s spirit has passed into him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but we call him Quincey.  In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.  When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing\\'s memorandum. We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee:--  \"We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her sweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so loved her, that they did dare much for her sake.\"  JONATHAN HARKER.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain \"Defects,\" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.  1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \"Right of Replacement or Refund\" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.

Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you \\'AS-IS\\', WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.  1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.  1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.  Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org  Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.  The Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact  Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
